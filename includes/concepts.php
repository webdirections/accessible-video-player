<h2>Guardrails or handcuffs? Building creative and sustainable design systems</h2>
<h3>Mark Boulton - Design Director, writer and speaker.</h3>
<strong><em>Keywords: zeitgeist, thingness, design systems, Olympics, branding, fractal grids, design elements, Manchester, consistency, deviation.</em></p>
<p>TL;DR: Mark introduces the concept of 'thingness' as a way to reconceptualize how we think of the goals of design systems relative to the culture and time they exist within. He proposes that design systems which create a thingness - a described system connecting products, content, and services - will help us move away from the prescriptive, constrictive sameness in our systems toward a more human approach. He extrapolates the concept from the zeitgeist of Manchester in the 1980s and walks us through examples where thingness was created from a range of design systems across a diverse set of industries. Through this process of explication, he demonstrates that the reality of our design systems lies outside pre-defined rigid patterns and that thingness, acknowledging deviations from these patterns is a way to create sustainable systems.</strong></p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:00:10">
<p>Mark is here to talk about design systems. There's a lovely German word: <strong>Zeitgeist,</strong> which means the spirit of the time. Design systems have been happening in the zeitgeist for a while now in modern product design, but today Mark would like to talk about how we move away from the <strong>prescriptive, constrictive sameness</strong> in our design systems and towards a <strong>more creative, potentially human approach.</strong></p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:00:46">
<p>Let's start by talking about Manchester! Mark grew up in Manchester. He hasn't lived there for a long time, but it's typically dreary and grey. However, it is the home of great music and is renowned for this.</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:01:12">
<p>Mark is a child of the eighties, and in 1989 there was a music and cultural scene dubbed Madchester. There was a lot of drug use that went on as part of this scene and one person was fairly central to the Madchester culture. He was a local reporter turned entrepreneur and was pervasive in what he produced and worked on. His name was Tony Wilson.</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:02:19">
<p>Tony Wilson founded <a href="https://factoryrecords.org/">Factory Records </a> which even if you haven't heard of it you would have seen and heard their output (ex: Happy Mondays, New Order). Factory Records hired local freelance designers to produce the cover art. The label was so prolific not just in terms of albums but in stickers on lamp posts, mail flyers, etc. As a design student in Manchester in the early 90s Mark was taught by some of these designers and their work was widely emulated. It became almost part of the DNA of the city. There was a <strong>hyperlocal sense of what it was to be in and of Manchester.</strong></p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:03:50">
<p>This was the zeitgeist of the time, but Mark likes to call it something else: <strong>Thingness.</strong> <em>There was a thingness about Manchester that wasn't a single thing, it was lots of little things that made up the feel of Manchester.</em> Why is Mark telling us this? Because for him, <strong>the goal of a design system is to create a thingness.</strong> A design system is a connectedness between products, content, and services. It's a described system.</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:04:43">
<p>Last year, Mark was giving a talk about design systems, and posed the question on Twitter: If I was a senior manager being asked to fund a five year design systems project, what would be the answer to these two questions:
<ol>
<li><em>What are the benefits of a design system?</em></li>
<li><em>What are the pitfalls, risks and difficulties?</em></li>
</ol>As you might expect, he received many replies. Many positive replies around <em>sustainability, use of scale and code, time saving, shared resources etc.</em> Many benefits articulated. Equally, there were negative comments: <em>Potential for being obsolete, ongoing commitment, considerable time and $ investment and no clear ROI.</em> What came through most loudly on the positives was the idea of consistency. Design systems <strong>solve the consistency problem </strong>and they enable <strong>scale, reach,</strong> and <strong>shared vocabulary</strong> between people and teams, They enable conversations around standards. They <em>surface organizational issues and can be a driving force for change within an organization.</em></p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:06:32">
<p> But there are challenges. Ethan Marcotte recently gave a <a href="https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/before-dawn-after-dusk/"> great talk </a> for <a href="https://www.meetup.com/SydCSS/"> SydCSS</a> which resonated strongly with Mark. He talked about a scenario he's seen within design system teams a lot in the past decade.</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:06:58">
<p>Mark will walk through what Ethan said and see if it resonates. We have a design system at the core of our organization and around it are product teams. These are the consumers of the system who take the components and rules of the system and apply it for customers and users; the products and people served by this system.</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:07:30">
<p>Ex: Let's assume a centrally produced component like <strong>an accordion.</strong> Every team takes and uses this accordion. This works, and this is what a lot of the positive benefits mentioned earlier were highlighting. However, as time goes by, one team (Team a) realizes they <em>need the accordion to do something slightly different.</em></p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:08:10">
<p>So they go to the design systems team (Team b) and say: <em>We need you to do something different.</em> The design systems team says: <em>Fine, but we need to go through a process of collaboration in order to make another accordion, as it has to be available for everyone else. So can we find scope within the current design pattern to adjust or tweak the accordion we already have?</em> The product team (Team a) are not satisfied with this solution as they need something more differentiated, so they fork it and create their own pattern because it's a faster and easier solution. This choice is often also informed by the pressure of shipping and the pressure of the bottom line. When these are prevalent, the design system team's needs take lower priority over getting the product out the door.</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:09:26">
<p>So another team (Team C) <em>have yet another slightly different accordion need,</em> and they do the same thing, fork it and make their own version. We are now in a position where we have a design system with three different accordions. As Ethan said: <q>This is normal and natural.</q> Don't panic! This is why collaboration is important and why <strong>the process of collaboration around design systems is important</strong> - <em>to smooth the way for exceptions and additions to those centrally provided patterns.</em></p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:10:31">
<p><strong>Consistency.</strong> With consistency being the issue and the driving motivation behind design systems, you have two product teams on either side while the design system sits in the middle trying to strike a balance between the two team's needs, with a compromised, best fit solution. But the proliferation of forked components will continue.</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:11:08">
<p>So how can we provide this consistency whilst the process of forking is happening? By controlling the usage of the system? Policing it? Coming down on those who deviate? <strong>OR:</strong> Document what people are doing with it, and paving the cowpaths that way?</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:11:27">
<p><a href="https://adactio.com/">Jeremy Keith</a> talks about this: as <strong>a system that is prescriptive.</strong> One that is <strong>defined, centralized,</strong> and <strong>controlled,</strong> where patterns and rules and uses like language are tightly defined and controlled centrally. Another type is a <strong>descriptive</strong> design system: One that is <strong>emergent, created,</strong> and <strong>built over time</strong> - 'paving those cowpaths' as components are forked and the design systems team build on top of them.</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:12:23">
<p><strong>There is an alternative: An enabling system.</strong> One that is <strong>looser, empowers teams,</strong> and <strong>allows for creativity</strong> (which is a natural human process).  <em>An enabling system <strong>creates a thingness;</strong> a sense of connectedness between elements in a design system.</em></p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:12:51">
<p>The good news is that this has been done before. Mark will go through two examples both drawn from the Olympics.  <em>Why use examples outside the digital field?</em> Because we have a duty as designers to look beyond our own fields and draw inspiration and learnings from other design disciplines. The Olympics are <em>almost on parallel in terms of scale of application:</em> consumer focused, B2B focused, and cover everything from <em>print and identity design</em> to <em>architecture</em> to <em>signage</em> to <em>fashion</em> to <em>iconography</em> and <em>typography</em><strong>- the whole gamut.</strong></p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:13:52">
<p>Ex 1) 2012 London Olympics. The design system of the Olympics was incredibly divisive. In the UK they call this 'a Marmite system', you either loved it or hated it.  But, the system was far-reaching and ambitious, and derived centrally from the <a href="https://www.sessions.edu/wp-content/uploads/london-2012.jpg/"> logo </a>and spread out across all material. The logo was designed by <a href="https://wolffolins.com/">Wolff Olins,</a> and the overall branding was by <a href="https://www.futurebrand.com/">  FutureBrand.</a></p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:14:48">
<p><strong>Central to this system was the fractal grid.</strong> It was the starting point for almost all things within the system. It was derived from the logo, and the grid became a tool to make design decisions with.  It was overlaid onto seating charts, informed the structure of wayfinding signage, entry tickets, and iconography. <em>The fractal grid created a sense of thingness.</em></p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:16:51">
<p>Ex 2) 1972 Munich Olympic Games. The design system created for the 1972 Olympics was hung on the central idea that this is a cheerful, joyful games. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otl_Aicher/">Otl Aicher </a>was the designer and the German Olympic Committee wanted to portray Germany as a vibrant, democratic modern country. <strong>The system was a celebration of this.</strong>. The design team were called Department 11 and comprised a team of approximately eighty multidisciplinary members. Holistic design reigned, from postcards to icons to programmes and tickets to souvenirs like Waldi the dog mascot, which you can still <a href="https://www.ebay.ca/sch/i.html?_sacat=0&_ssc=1&_nkw=waldi+olympic/"> buy on ebay. </a></p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:19:24">
<p>The system for the London Games went all the way down to the architecture and landscaping. The Munich system included volunteer outfits and souvenir design. Aicher conceived his design system as <q><strong>Strictly designed grammar allowing for free, playful expression.</strong></q> Mark loves that there are strictly designed rules, but enough freedom within those rules to allow for that deviation and human expression whilst keeping a connectedness between all produced elements.  Mark extracts this as having<q><strong> Simple, easily communicable rules allowing for human expression.</strong></q> How do we allow for that human expression within our digital design systems today?</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:20:48">
<p><strong>Articulate the design space</strong> In type design, typefaces are designed within a design space. Ex: Boldness, slant, and width axes can be extracted into a cube-like form which is a useful model within which design decisions can happen. This is how type designers work: <em>they conceptualize and produce their typefaces through instances and subsequent interpolations within this space.</em></p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:22:25">
<p>For the 2012 Games, they did this within the design space of the fractal grid. This helps with <em>one critical question that comes up when you want to deviate from a system that is prescriptive. What does this look like?</em> Anything outside the system not operating in a design space is a challenge because<em> those decisions are <strong>subjective.</strong></em> Designers, stakeholders and clients have to do the justification dance instead of <strong>relying on the system.</strong></p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:23:36">
<p>A few years ago, Mark did some work with <a href="https://home.cern/">CERN.</a>They wanted a new website, so Mark tried to articulate this design space: <em>What does it mean to the different audiences of CERN how they and their content is perceived and understood?</em> Many compare CERN to <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/">NASA; </a><strong>NASA explores outer space, CERN explores inner space.</strong> NASA have images from space. CERN have visualizations of the collisions that happen within the Large Hadron Collider. So a critical moment in the articulation of what their design system might look like was asking: <em>What is wondrous about the work that CERN do?</em></p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:25:14">
<p>They began by looking at the CERN website audience, who would all have <strong>different levels of comprehension</strong> about the material they were viewing. The general public may have a low understanding of particle physics, whereas scientists would have a high comprehension. By <strong>overlaying an axis of wonder</strong> over the notion of comprehension you can <strong>capture the needs and wants of both segments.</strong> Mark's team plotted various points of the website to correspond with the scale from low to high re: comprehension and wonder as <em>metrics reflecting user emotion.</em> Ex: they used large, high res images on the homepage to appeal high on the 'wonder' scale. The inverse to this was 'the CERN directory', one of the first webpages that was made for CERN which was purely functional and comprised mostly links to various department and experiment pages.</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:27:45">
<p>Prior to CERN, Mark worked at the <a href="https://www.embl.de/">European Molecular Biology Lab. </a>He tried a similar approach in this project. They tried a range of models and ways of articulating the design space but none would stick. The digital teams and some broader teams that would use the design system understood what the concept was, but too many key stakeholders did not. In the end, it came down to the idea of a <strong>volume knob. </strong>(<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088258/"> Spinal tap ref! </a><q>The numbers all go to eleven.</q>)The idea was that they could tune up or down several axes - specifically <em>colour, imagery,</em> and <em>layering.</em> They could go through a product/website/service application and score it on a scale of 1-5. This gave a <strong>ranking system to determine the feeling of system components</strong> which could be used <strong>to inform the corresponding design approach.</strong></p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:29:36">
<p>Ex: Homepage was visually splashy with collages and images, while page communicating data from the annual report is more text heavy but still includes infographics for easy digestion. These were designed to <strong>cater to specific audiences.</strong> This was important for research groups within EMBL who had their own websites. For them to adopt them Mark's team had to provide various sliders and options in order to allow them creativity and express their work and identity. Some research groups were more active in the process than others.</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:31:14">
<p>The broader concept here is around: <strong>articulating the design space and providing guardrails or edges of where you can deviate to.</strong> You can provide that <strong>through examples,</strong> which many branding systems do. Ex: Olympics producing sets of rules around strict grammar; type, colour, iconography, devices [e.g. fractal grid] which they provide a number of application examples. This <strong>creates a toolkit</strong> that other professions can interpret and express natively via their own preferred media (for ex: This can be done digitally.) The other method is <strong>bake the variants into components.</strong>  Ex: Accordion with four, five, eight variations. Many design systems currently use this method to accommodate the volume range. Or you can <strong>change variables at the component level</strong> through the use of design tokens; being able to change background colours, typography, icons etc.</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:33:02">
<p><strong>Final thoughts.</strong> Mark loves <a href="https://brucelee.com/bruce-lee/">Bruce Lee, </a>who in his prime broke his back. In hospital he began thinking about his own unique style of martial arts. He had been trained in a particular system but it did not work with the realities of combat. He devised his own system based on <strong>flexibility</strong> and <strong>adaptability.</strong> Quote from Bruce Lee: <q>My followers in Jeet Kune Do know this: All fixed set patterns are incapable of adaptability or pliability. The truth lies outside of fixed patterns.</q> <strong>The thingness, acknowledging deviations from a pre-defined system is a way to create sustainable systems.</strong> The reality of our design systems lies outside pre-defined rigid patterns.</p>

<h2>Breathing room for Design</h2>
<h3>Sharbani Dhar, Director–Design Operations, Michelle O’Reilly, Lead product designer, Australia Post</h3>

<p><strong><em>Keywords: Australia Post, pandemic, dual track, brick and mortar, mail redirection, SAFe, discovery, experience, delivery.</em></p>
<p>TL;DR: Sharbani and Michelle offer a case study of how <a href="https://auspost.com.au/">Australia Post </a>- a bricks and mortar enterprise with complex logistical and technical challenges -  found solutions to the challenge of creating breathing room in the midst of pandemic. By adopting a 'dual track', collaborative approach between the concepts of delivery and discovery, and at the same time anchoring experience between the two, their teams were able to achieve success across a range of metrics. Beyond metrics, by iterating an approach grounding in transparency and delight, they were better able to respond to the moment with a flexible outlook which also yielded unexpected opportunities for insight.</strong></p>
<p>Sharbani: Before we start, let me tell you a story about Gina. She is a quintessential community activist and friend of Sharbani. At the outset of the pandemic, she started to sew. She sewed approx: 30 facemasks following a set of sewing instructions she found on an Australian Government Health website. She distributed them to friends and neighbours. Then she went to the supermarket whilst wearing one and immediately issued a product recall on all the masks she had given away. <strong>the problem: no breathing room.</strong> The mask was too tight. After trying other methods she found a pattern for a mask with a looser fit and more coverage and comfort.</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:01:12">
	<p><strong>This is exactly what design teams in an enterprise face every day.</strong> In an urgency to hit the market, we often build in a prescribed way without having the time or room to question it. However, we don't have the luxury that Gina did to pivot and put out a new product the next day. <em>There's no breathing room for design to conceive and execute a delightful solution.</em></p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:01:42">
	<p>Sharbani is Design Director at Australia Post, an enterprise that has been the backbone of Australia for over 200 years.</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:01:52">
	<p>Michelle: is the UX Design Lead at Australia Post.</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:02:02">
	<p><blockquote>ABC Journalist Diana Eliot writes:<em> Post offices fulfill a social service as well as a commercial one. They stand stoically in townships decimated by floors, plagues, and financial ruin, like chimneys rising from the ashes of homes destroyed by fire.</em></blockquote></p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:02:05">
	<p>Sharbani and Michelle will take us through a case study of how they created breathing room within their enterprise. It's been a journey of trial and error that they are continuously looking to improve. They will share key learnings as many are facing similar challenges.</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:02:22">
	<p>Sharbani: First, a few facts about Australia Post: AP is <strong>210 years old.</strong> The first Postmaster-General Issac Nichols was a convict transported to NSW for stealing. He was responsible for collecting the mail from newly-arrived ships and distributing it to the colonies. The first post office was in George St, Sydney; they now have <strong>4300 post offices across 7.5 million square miles.</strong></p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:02:59">
	<p>Post offices are the lifeblood of rural Australia. They are a key enabler of e-commerce and serve the entire population from urbanites to people in tiny outback towns. A key insight they hear through user research is that when banks close in small towns, residents are not terribly worried. But when post offices close, people are very worried. They associate having a post office with being connected and important to the rest of the country. This imbues a high level of trust in Australia Post which in turn requires them to meet that responsibility.</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:03:46">
	<p>In 2019, <em>AP sent <strong>3.3 billion items</strong> across 12.1 million local addresses and 214 countries across the world.</em><strong> With the advent of Covid, volumes have increased to triple the usual amount. </strong> TL;DR: They're big! And making change is hard. Some days Sharbani and Michelle feel that they are working with technology from Mr. Issac Nichols himself! Having a large footprint means they have <strong>multiple operational dependencies and complexities</strong> and this has become more obvious than ever before during the pandemic.</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:04:37">
	<p>Michelle: The digital team at AP are the <strong>facilitators</strong> for experiences. It's their job to <strong>connect</strong> with customers virtually. <em>Critically, they are the <strong>key channel for communication</strong> during emergencies, floods, bushfires, and the pandemic.</em> The digital team is made up of more than 500 people working across 20 engineering teams across 4-5 major programs of work.</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:05:16">
	<p>For delivery, they follow the Scaled Agile Framework for Enterprise <a hreaf="https://www.scaledagile.com/enterprise-solutions/what-is-safe/">(SAFe) </a> which is a framework that allows complex enterprises to adopt Agile methodologies within dev teams to enable them to function in a <em>lean, nimble, and agile manner. </em>The whole digital team plans together every quarter and have check-ins every 6 weeks to reassess progress and planning where they map dependencies with other teams to <strong>ensure they aren't operating in silos</strong> but are <strong>communicating and planning together.</strong></p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:06:11">
	<p>SAFe is a software product. It's been constant trial and error to mould and shape this process to ensure that the experience team's needs are also being accounted for.  The challenge for the experience team ilies in building software for a large brick and mortar enterprise using legacy tech and old-school stakeholders for a diversity of users across the country.</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:06:35">
	<p>Not just how you <strong>build</strong> the software but <strong>how you design it in a way that's simple, useful, and delightful for customers.</strong> What's the sweet spot that allows breathing room for our customers and allows design to inform strategy? A sweet spot:</p>
<ol>
<li>That allows for thinking time yet enables quick delivery.</li>
<li>That is inclusive and enables collaboration.</li>
<li> That enables the right tools for a problem.</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:07:08">
	<p>Sharbani: We tried a multitude of experiments to search for our sweet spot; working a few sprints ahead; just in time for devs; design sprints, etc. Then decided to go <strong>Dual Track,</strong> where the <strong>discovery</strong> track and <strong>delivery</strong> track run parallel but without a time dependency on each other. At the same time, experience continues its discovery toward an evolving vision that teams can use as a beacon; experience becomes the incremental realization of that vision.</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:07:50">
	<p>Discovery Track kicks off end to end research and design activities that would ideally be a quarter to six weeks in advance of delivery. Once they <strong>discover insights,</strong> the delivery team can start to pick them up as opportunity swapping points. As research matures, delivery can plan bigger.</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:08:20">
	<p><strong>Why this works:</strong> It removes time dependency between experience research and delivery; allowing <strong>the breathing room</strong> to think, unpack, and invite cross channel collaboration. Slicing of learnings from research into smaller pieces of delivery allowed delivery teams to work toward<strong> meaningful and viable outcomes.</strong> Identifying quick wins also allowed quick, not expensive fails.</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:09:04">
	<p><strong>Double Diamond Approach.</strong> The first half of the diamond is learn, where the discovery track kicks off. The second half of the diamond is the create half, where delivery kicks off.  <em>First we learn, then we create.</em> Discovery does not apply only to the experience team and delivery does not reside solely with tech. For this to work it is <strong>critical to identify the right balance of people for driving the right parts.</strong></p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:09:49">
	<p>The participants of discovery track are: the product managers from viability, the software architect from tech, and the design directors from design. The participants of delivery track are: business analysts from viability, the developers from tech, and designers from design.</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:10:16">
	<p><strong>While these two tracks run parallel, the producers, iteration managers, and the leads become the connectors of the two tracks.</strong>  Having roles that work upstream and roles that work downstream with characters in the process who ensure that there is a constant dialogue happening between the two facilitates and makes space and breathing room to focus on <em>the right parts of the process at the right time.</em></p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:10:48">
	<p>From Day One, the whole team were committed to <strong>transparency of processes and methods.</strong> The team were unclear about UX processes, so time was taken to explain and answer questions. They also instigated a weekly shareback/open forum explaining the decisions that were being made. It was an open forum for collaboration open to all teams.</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:11:27">
	<p>Michelle: Our first experiment in the new delivery approach was in mail redirection, which is one of the most expensive services that AP provides. It also drives the <strong>maximum of calls and customer complaints.</strong> When they began delivery track, they had an <strong>unclear problem</strong> and <strong>an unclear solution.</strong> Customer complaints were not the problem. They were the symptom. Discovery track allowed them to separate the problems from the symptoms and see <em>what is really impacting customers and staff?</em></p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:12:16">
	<p>Simultaneously, they learned that <strong>30k customers were unable to verify their identity online</strong> owing to special ID requirements and thus had to call directly. This allowed them to <strong>identify an opportunity</strong> they could add to their delivery backlog. We could open up servicing 85% of concession customers online.  Big win for concession customers who have high rates of mobility issues and travel cost barriers. Particularly helpful during Covid.</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:12:58">
	<p>Through continuous research throughout the project, they uncovered many issues, but the biggest one was that <strong>they kept getting in their own way.</strong> <em>Over time, people spotted opportunities to piggyback on the traffic of this product.</em> Over the years, multiple upsells that were distracting for viewers had slipped their way into the flow and <strong>eroded the experience.</strong> During testing, customers would get so distracted with upsells that they would forget their original intent. The solution: <strong>Move upsells outside the flow to increase overall conversion rates.</strong></p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:13:36">
	<p>Most importantly, this analysis <strong>allowed them to set up the right measures of success,</strong> which became their <em>criteria to continue optimization post delivery.</em> They used <strong>data to inform decisions</strong> and decide when features were suitable to be released into production. This allowed them to get big changes across the line and build stakeholder trust.</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:14:04">
	<p>The project was a success, coming in ahead of schedule and on budget. It met and exceeded objectives and proved value. <em>What does this mean?</em> Having the breathing room to collaborate and actively work through dual track has allowed them to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build partnerships instead of receiving a list of requirements.</li>
<li>Establish a continuous culture of measure and learning.</li>
<li>Prove the value of design and experience to the point that now design informs strategy.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:14:49">
	<p><strong>So... what does this all mean for you?</strong> Sharbani: <strong>Creating breathing room starts with creating transparency.</strong> A brick and mortar enterprise which has multiple operations trying to work together cannot always have a prescribed process. But whatever process you choose needs to start with creating transparency about it for all the players involved. We as design can't sit in a corner and complain that we don't get heard. We started by asking for a seat at the table without necessarily offering a chair at our own. Getting out of that mindset and having partnerships enabled them to build and try different methods.</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:15:29">
	<p><strong>A framework is good as long as you allow a bit of push and pull within it.</strong> To create breathing room means not being a fundamentalist in Agile, design thinking, or sprints. Rather, identify what works best for the opportunity. <em>Don't drink the Kool-Aid just because the cult leader says!</em> Know that <strong>different roles in an organization work better at different instances of the problem solving process.</strong> Identify and utilize them. <strong>Agree</strong> early on as to what <strong>metrics</strong> you will use to prove the work. <strong>Validate</strong> their relevance as part of your research, and <strong>implement and monitor</strong> them as part of your delivery.</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:16:28">
	<p>Finally, remember that <strong>it's never over, it's part of a continuous process of improvement.</strong> Thankyou!</p>

<h2>Make Me Pretty.</h2>
<h3>Emma Carter - UX Design & Product Lead - ThoughtWorks</h3>
<p><strong><em>Keywords: Visual design, aesthetic design, sensory design, visual cortex, psychological pleasure.</em></p>
<p>TL;DR: Emma shares the latest research in psychology and neurology to offer insight into how we process design elements. Through a range of examples, she demonstrates how good visual design can speed up data perception, help us retain data for much longer, trigger pleasure, guide our attention and make an app or website more accessible by using a universal user interface.</strong></p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/">Nielsen Norman </a>study, when you were deciding to attend this talk you spent ten percent more time looking at Emma's speaker profile than reading her bio. As visual designers, many of our decisions can come across to others as if we're just <em><strong>making things look pretty,</strong></em> or that we love clean white space with a preference for particular images and colours.  But <strong>visual design decisions can seriously impact UX and cause the user's brain to work harder to connect dots and process information.</strong></p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:00:45">
<p>The way we design can <strong>help</strong> or <strong>hinder</strong> the user's ability to find their way quickly, which in turn can <strong>increase</strong> or <strong>decrease</strong> a <strong>brand's credibility,</strong> which affects profit margins and success or failure of products.</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:01:02">
 <p>Visual design affects user behaviour and the overall product experience. <strong>It takes only 150 milliseconds for the brain to process an image and another 100 milliseconds to understand its meaning.</strong> Good visual design can speed up data perception, help us retain data for much longer, trigger pleasure, guide our attention and make an app or website more accessible by using a universal user interface, particularly when working across different languages (icons in particular are relevant here).</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:01:26">
 <p><strong>65% of the population are visual learners</strong> and nearly 500 million people use Instagram daily to post photos, comments, and stories. <strong>Visual design significantly impacts the overall product experience.</strong> The recent rise in popularity of design sprints, MVP, and the rush to test and validate an idea is helpful in gathering feedback but often means that visual design of a product is left until the last minute or misses opportunities for refinement. Budgets and time constraints mean teams don't get the chance to polish and create a better product experience for customers, but 65% of the population are visual learners.</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:02:13">
 <p>You have just 50 milliseconds before users make final judgements on a digital product. Ex: SaaS companies that offer free trials have to convince customers very quickly of their solution and value.  Microsoft have calculated that they make eighty million dollars annually simply through using one particular shade of blue. Visual design matters!</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:03:30">
 <p>Why does colour make such an impact? (Not only on the user, but on brand value and revenue)? <em><strong>Can visual design impact the user's psychological state (for good or ill)?</strong></em></p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:03:43">
 <p>Emma will cover:
<ul>
<li>How our brains work</li>
<li>The psychological impact of visual design</li>
<li>Brand connection and how they are evolving digitally</li>
<li>Aesthetic usability effect</li>
</ul></p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:03:53">
 <p><strong>How our brains work:</strong> We process sensory data <em>in parallel as we interact with the world around us.</em>  Different regions of our brain are simultaneously activated through networks or neurons. This is called <strong>visual perception</strong> - the brain's ability to make sense of what the eyes see. In the end, whatever we design visually comes down to how our brain sees and understands that information.</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:04:17">
 <p><strong>Forty percent of brain nerves are connected to the retina, and ninety percent of everything that comes to our mind is given by visual stimuli.</strong> Our brain can capture images that the eye sees for as little as <strong>thirteen milliseconds, ten times faster than a wink.</strong> This means that we've evolved to absorb visual information at an absurd speed. <em>Vision is the sense that we most depend on in our daily lives.</em> Despite advances in image processing and AI, the way our brains process images is <strong>vastly superior.</strong> Visual processing in the cortex occurs through <strong>two distinct streams of information.</strong></p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:04:46">
 <p>One stream is the <em>where</em> pathway which recognizes the location of objects and the other is the <em>what</em> pathway which is involved in recognizing and identifying objects.</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:05:03">
 <p>The visual cortex has a clear hierarchical arrangement. In the lower areas the most amount of light that comes through. This is where we process basic visual signals (ex: the orientation of a bar or the direction an object is moving). The neurons here respond mostly to input from one eye. As we work up the hierarchy into more complex responses, neurons respond to more complex visual features (ex: contours, textures, foreground or background object placement.)</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:05:40">
 <p>At the top of this stream the information gets split into the what and where streams. In the what area there is part called the <strong>fusiform face area</strong> which specifically responds to faces. The where stream is involved in tasks like guiding eye movements and integrating vision with body position (ex: reaching for an object).</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:06:10">
 <p>The bottom to top processing of our visual world may seem like a logical path, but <strong>we're more complex.</strong>The bottom up approach would be too slow and ambiguous for us to survive. Instead, our perception relies largely on previous experiences and other top down mechanisms.</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:06:38">
 <p>Ex: the gold/grey/blue/white dress image/perception of light and dark.</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:07:46">
 <p>Our brains are constantly trying to make sense of what they see. When designing, whether for digital interfaces, advertising, software etc, we need to <strong>reduce visual stress</strong> and help users' brains process the information faster. <a href="https://www.lightspeedhq.com/"> Lightspeed</a> collaborated with a digital graphics agency to do a huge study on various visual aids. They conducted <em>over seventy experiments, tested over 500 visuals, icons, charts and infographics, and worked with over 10 000 people across five different countries.</em>  They found that when designing icons, the more literal the visual, the better. <strong>Accuracy matters</strong> and <strong>icons literally have to be iconic.</strong> Simple one or two colour icons are processed far faster than more technical and brighlty colour images. We've seen this paring some and simplicity over the past fifteen years or so in the field of design more broadly.</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:09:35">
 <p><strong>Reduce Visual Stress:</strong> We don't want to cause visual stress by cluttering the design and adding too many data points or unwanted design elements. Remember <em>we have only fifty milliseconds before users have made their first judgement on our product.</em> We need to ensure a good impression from the outset. <strong>We need to constantly test and refine our visual designs, particularly when launching new products or features.</strong></p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:10:05">
 <p>Ex:<a href="https://www.uber.com/"> Uber</a> spent a lot of time optimizing their landing page to improve UX through visual design. The original was a simple photo banner over a white background with a few icons and text. Uber used eye tracking heatmaps to gather and visualize data about which sections and elements of their landing page were capturing the most viewer attention. They found too much heat around an image on the old page due to the person in the image making direct eye contact with the viewer, so redirected this heat to the signup buttons on the new page by having the person gazing towards the buttons and thus drawing the visitors eye to this section. They also found that separating the sign up options from the headline cooled the attention to them.</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:13:53">
<p><strong>Satisfying our senses and emotions</strong> As designers we try and create an emotional connection to the product we've created. Sociologist Edward Thorndike wrote a paper in the 20s called <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/A-constant-error-in-psychological-ratings.-Thorndike/0a2ad6af640c93bf222da9b13a616afd05fc979b/"><em>The Constant Error in Psychological Ratings</em></a> and in it, coined the term: the halo effect.</p>
<p><blockquote><em>There is a phenomenon that social psychologists call <strong>'the halo effect'.</strong> It means humans tend to assume that <strong>good-looking people</strong> have other positive qualities aside from their looks.</em> - Edward Thorndike</blockquote></p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:14:24">
 <p>Extrapolating this to digital products, <em>people tend to believe that <strong>things that look better will work better,</strong> even if they aren't actually more attractive or efficient.</em><q>What is beautiful is usable.</q> Tractinsky, 2000. Users have a positive emotion response to visual design, which makes them more tolerant to minor usability issues. This is generally a plus, as you've already designed visually. But it also means we need to be careful in user-testing, ensuring we test the rough concepts before doing the hi-fi design.</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:15:09">
 <p><strong>Aesthetically pleasing design satisfies our senses and gives us pleasure.</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vision is the most dominant sense in the majority of people</strong> Key elements for good visual design include: color, shape, pattern, line, texture, visual weight, balance, scale, proximity and movement. Using these elements well will help us achieve good visual aesthetics.</li>
<li><strong>Hearing: our ears are capable of perceiving a whole other level of aesthetic design.</strong> Being able to hear how a car engine works or hearing aural digital notifications impact our senses.  Key elements in sound aesthetics design are loudness, pitch, beat, repetition, melody, pattern, and noise. Using them well will create enjoyable 'music' for our users.</li>
<li><strong>Touch: Skin is the largest organ in the human body.</strong> It helps us experience material aesthetics that are especially important for physical products.</li>
</ul></p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:16:12">
 <p>As brands begin to explore more around AR and VR, we need to tap into all the senses to create great customer experiences.  Some signs are so ingrained in our memories that we need only look at an image to hear the aural association in our minds (Ex: MGM's Leo the Lion). But we need balance as some sounds can be very annoying to users</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:16:28">
 <p><strong>First impressions matter.</strong> When we perceive beauty with more of our senses we feel a deeper pleasure from the design. We need to create designs that are aesthetically pleasing, reduce visual stress, and tap into the senses to give our users pleasure from the start, which helps them form a bond with the design that sticks long beyond the initial interaction. <strong>Users' expectations have evolved in tandem with the breadth of design and technology now available and now go beyond desire for functionality/usability. They want the experience to stimulate their senses and evoke a positive emotion.</strong> Aesthetic design is crucial in satisfying these needs, and is perceived as more usable, valuable, and friendly. (However there are still cases where usability must take priority. Ex: emergency equipment. Design for your audience.)</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:17:34">
 <p>Really annoying when we can't understand a product or navigate an app. Competition is fierce. But are the design decisions that we are making creating good and bad habits for our users?</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:17:56">
 <p><strong>Psychological Impact.</strong>
<a href="https://www.nirandfar.com/">Nir Eyal's </a>customer engagement manual <a href="https://www.nirandfar.com/hooked/">Hooked: How to Build Habit Forming Products</a> describes various triggers designs can use to create more habit-forming online environments. Ex: constant notifications from social media apps infiltrate our minds and trigger neat freaks to view and clear them.</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:19:10">
 <p>Social networking sites seek to embed themselves at the centre of the user's emotional life. <q>Instagram exploits the quiet anxiety that occurs when users fear a special moment will be lost forever</q> <strong>(Also known as FOMO!)</strong> This need to document and preserve is supported by app features that make poor quality images more attractive.</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:19:44">
 <p><blockquote><em><strong>Users who find a product that alleviates their pain will form strong, positive associations with the product over time...</strong> These bonds cement into a habit as users turn to your product when experiencing certain internal triggers.</em> - Nir Eyal, 2014</blockquote></p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:19:59">
 <p><blockquote><em>Interaction designs answer to our penchant for endlessly searching for novelty.</em> - Nir Eyal</blockquote> Endlessly refreshed content activates dopamine in using not to provide us with rewards for our efforts but to keep us searching by inducing semi-stressful responses that we call desire.</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:20:25">
 <p><blockquote><em><strong>'Mining' dopamine</strong> in the human brain is a core technique for <strong>driving digital consumption</strong></em> - Gerald Moore</blockquote></p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:20:30">
 <p>Gerald Moore has also done a lot of work around dopamine levels and suggests that repetitive behaviours that stimulate more dopamine hits (ex: scrolling, 'liking' a post) produce changes in the brain's neural pathways which narrows attention and reduce the varieties of stimuli that feel good. He advocates for paying more attention to understanding the experiential and cultural implications of living in a digital society where design mechanisms constantly work to stimulate our brain to distract, lure, and entice us. As designers we need to be mindful of this.</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:21:19">
 <p><strong>Psychological pleasure</strong> can also be derived from completing a task or feeling in control and safe.  This can be <strong>very tightly related to product usability but also how it looks.</strong> Using aesthetics plays a big role in giving users a sense of safety and control. The goal is to make a product look and feel simple and stable and guiding the user.</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:21:50">
 <p>We can also trigger psychological pleasure by <strong>taking a sustainability angle.</strong> If the user feels they have contributed to a cause they are passionate about they are more engaged with the product. Ex: <a href="https://www.girlfriend.com/">The Girlfriend Collective,</a> who make leggings out of plastic and focus on the whole lifestyle of the product from production through to disposal. The result is that they have <em>diverted six million post-consumer plastic water bottles and counting from landfill since inception.</em> Employees in Vietnam are paid above minimum wage starting at 125% above the wage in the country. They also provide meals and healthcare to employees. They are tapping into the user pleasure from conscious consumption and their messaging focuses around triggering this pleasure.</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:23:28">
 <p><Strong>Creating Brand Connection.</strong> How are brands combining branding with UI to extend beyond a surface level identity and actually solve customer problems.</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:23:42">
 <p>Ex: <a href="https://www.hoteltonight.com/">Hotel Tonight, </a>whose<strong> logo has boosted revenue by more than 10% annually.</strong> They help users find last minute hotel rooms and deeply discounted rates. They focused on creating a really simple UI where users could find and book a room in only three taps. But they <strong>made it too easy.</strong> In 2011 when they launched, two in every thousand customers were booking accidentally. The bookings were also non refundable. So the CEO decided to issue refunds, but this <em>cut into profits by 4%</em> They tried various solutions (ex: asking users to enter their initials before final confirmation but this felt clunky and corporate) and eventually one of the engineers came up with the solution for users to trace over the logo to confirm bookings. Adding an anti-pattern in (trace instead of tap) <em>forced users to slow down and think before they booked.</em> The logo went from simply being a brand icon but also a clever UI feature that dramatically increased revenues, not just through reducing refunds due to bookings made in error but also through the non-completed bookings dropping by 75%.</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:25:50">
 <p>Sam Shank, CEO of HotelTonight says: <blockquote><em>It's become this <strong>iconic feature </strong>of HotelTonight...We now say, <strong>three taps and swipe</strong> to book a hotel tonight.</em>
</blockquote></p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:25:57">
 <p>Pretty design can make users more forgiving of minor useability problems but not of large ones.  <em>If the user can't <strong>find</strong> the product, the user can't <strong>buy</strong> the product.</em> Even great looking sites will have no revenue if they suffer from poor findability, or if the UI is too simple, or if the company needs to offer huge refunds.</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:26:20">
 <p><strong>Attractive + Functional.</strong> Form and function need to work together and designing an interface that's attractive as well as function is worth resources. At the end of the day first impressions matter. <strong>Aesthetic design influences how people think and feel.</strong><em> It taps into the senses, influences how much pleasure we feel from the product; it reduces the processing load of our brains and reduces visual stress, making users more brand loyal and tolerant towards mistakes or failures.</em> Think of the new Apple interface upgrade: Emma finds this super annoying. First impressions are not the only factor that matters, <em>design also impacts our long term attitude toward brands.</em> Good design should aim to keep strengthening the bond with the user over time.</p>

<h2>How UX Can Help Us Humanize Products in the COVID-19 Era (and Beyond)</h2>
<h3>Ashley Hefnawy - Creative + UX Writer</h3>
<strong><em>Keywords: Human Experience, User Experience, human-centered copy, product experience, branding, umami theory, 2020 reckoning, Covid insights, HX vs UX.</em></p>
<p>TL;DR: Ashley invites us to join her in using some of the insights gleaned during 2020 and its associated reckonings to re-imagine and reframe how we conceive of and write about user experience. By replacing the phrase 'user experience' (UX) with the more spacious and encompassing phrase: 'human experience' (HX) we can better communicate about, write about, and respond to the lived experience of the humans using our products and evolve the way we work and the way we understand and translate our work. HX allows our conception of products to move from existing in siloed worlds created for 'ideal' users to instead existing within realtime narratives and landscapes.</strong></p>
<p>Ashley is going to talk about UX specifically through the lens of writing and how she has reimagined it as the human experience rather than user experience.</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:00:46">
<p><strong>Snapshot:</strong> This presentation will cover 6 areas of focus:</p>
<ol>
<li> Intro - who Ashley is, why she's here, what is she known for and how does she spend her time.</li>
<li>What is UX writing - defining the term, what's changed during Covid and what does UX need to look like in the future?</li>
<li>UX vs HX - The difference between user experience and human experience, how the latter can help us think more holistically.</li>
<li>The Umami Theory - <em>everything is cancelled and it's the beginning of the end of the experience economy as we've come to know it.</em></li>
<li>2020's Reckoning - how we can reckon with the truth and what does it mean for our products?</li>
<li>Beyond Branding - Writing for the human experience means writing the truth, and using branding for good, allowing HX writing to be part of that.</li>
</ol>

</section>
<section data-startTime="00:02:01">
<p>Ashley is a creative, writer, artist, community events organizer, cat enthusiast. She's been writing professionally for a decade for a range of clients in the area of communications: copywriting, marketing, and web, with a recent pivot to UX writing. She is often hired by brands/companies to humanize their voice and ensure clarity.  During the pandemic, she's been dissecting what it means to write UX copy and grappling with a certain disparity she's noticed especially within the tech space.</p>
</section>

<section data-startTime="00:03:35">
<p><strong>What is UX Writing?</strong> Many people outside the tech space don't know what UX writing is. Ashley finds this odd because she sees UX writing as embedded in everything we do. It's the <strong>name that throws people off,</strong> but when the <em><strong>purpose</strong> of UX writing is explained,</em> people tend to understand. UX writing is:</p>
<ul>
<li>The communications that help us get from point A to point B.</li>
<li>Extremely meta. - It often feels like talking about the box within the box. Often, those experiencing UX and UX writing are not necessarily cognizant of what they're engaging with. Why?</li>
<li>The vibe, the atmosphere, how we're feeling inside the actual product.</li>
<li>The fastest and easiest way to make us feel smart of dumb. When it's bad, it can make us feel dumb, frustrated, or Luddite.</li>
</ul>

</section>
<section data-startTime="00:05:40">
<p>Ashley tries to explain UX as simply as possible, and this has led her to reframe the way she talks about it by speaking about <strong>the humans using the products</strong> rather than using the term <strong>UX writing</strong> which can be obfuscating.</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:06:12">
<p><strong>Why are we talking about it today?</strong> Like many of us, Ashley has spent a lot of time this year evaluating the work she's doing and evaluating the landscape in which UX writing and her own writing exist.</p>
<ol>
<li>Covid-19 has drastically changed everything about UX.</li>
<li>Humanity turns to products and systems for help in times of distress.</li>
<li>Good products that help humanity require UX that doesn't get in the way- if you are in a positive product experience, you are likely not thinking about UX</li>
<li>Good UX writing relies on a product that cares about its people! Can't have good UX if the product doesn't care about its user. This is key. You can't use UX writing to cover up a product that doesn't care.</li> 
</ol>

</section>
<section data-startTime="00:07:40">
<p><strong>The Future:</strong> We're framing UX writing within a 2020/Covid perspective and Ashley is thinking about the future and how her work will evolve. <strong><em>There is no returning back to normal.</em></strong> Everything is different and evolving. Everything is getting the magnifying glass treatment. <strong> Cancel culture lacks depth</strong> (this is a broader topic for another day!), and <strong>accountability is in.</strong> We are trying to hold ourselves and our communities accountable, <em>as well as the products we engage with.</em> How does this affect UX writing and products?</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:08:54">
<p><strong>User Experience vs Human Experience.</strong> Ashley loves naming things and much of her job involves rebranding. If she'd been involved in the naming process for 'User Experience' she would have called it: <strong>Human Experience (or HX).</strong> This may not be particularly groundbreaking, but it's <em>an important distinction to make in how we conceive users vs humans.</em> <strong>Human</strong> feels more natural and less generic. Let's talk about why this name feels more in line with how she works as a UX writer.</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:10:00">
<p><strong>UX vs HX.</strong> Let's compare UX (or simply user) with HX (or simply human).</p>
<ul>
<li>UX feels general/generic while HX feels less 'jargon-y' and more specific.</li>
<li>UX lacks emotion vs HX feels more holistic.</li>
<li>For those unfamiliar with UX it can be confusing, but saying 'human experience' it feels more relatable, public facing and philosophical.</li>
<li>HX leaves room for natural curiosity and also opens doors to conversations about the actual work and helps ground the focus of UX writing in <strong>how the products help humans.</strong>
<li>HX is more of a <strong>values-based</strong> approach. UX: Could be anything? A dog? Something with thumbs? vs HX: Immediately feel connected, empathy.</li>
</ul>

</section>
<section data-startTime="00:11:16">
<p>The bigger picture/frame of this is that Ashley uses a <strong>values first approach</strong> in her work.  She performs a values-based assessment before taking on any new project - <em>Does the product/project align with my personal values,</em> and reciprocally: <em>Is the value I am bringing needed or worthwhile?</em> Greater clarity around these questions comes when thinking of UX as HX. <strong>HX allows the conception of products to move from existing in siloed worlds created for 'ideal' users to instead existing within realtime narratives and landscapes.</strong> Products are too often slow to evolve with the reality of the world they exist within. UX feels like a child of the tech space, which is fine. But given that 2020 is lending itself to widespread re-evaluation and particularly re-evaluation of how we want to evolve the nature of our work, <em><strong>why not also re-evaluate the word that describes what we do?</strong></em></p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:13:07">
<p>This boils down to striving to write <strong>human experience copy,</strong> <em>copy which is cognizant of the world and the environment in which it is situated.</em></p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:13:15">
<p>Framing this through real world realtime examples: Ex: In response to the pandemic seriously restricting travel, <a href="https://www.airbnb/"> Airbnb’s</a> messaging pivoted from <em>Belong anywhere</em> to:<em> Get away without going far.</em> You are regularly reminded throughout your app experience that travel is currently challenging. These reminders aren’t done in an alarmist way but in a reassuring and we're-being-responsible-and-acknowledging-reality way.  Safety and hygiene protocol info is prominent throughout app experience. This approach is somewhat pragmatic in that Airbnb’s platform depends on their ability to create systems that centre human comfort, but had they failed to convey this heightened safety messaging, not only would they lose market value in the short term but risk longer term damage to their reputation.</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:15:39">
<p>By contrast, another example from hospitality. This industry should be a leader in communication in 2020 as they are at the forefront of humans wanting to experience a reality other than the one grounded in staying home/not socializing. There is both rich potential as well as inherent social responsibility in promoting safe, healthy travel and socializing in accordance with what is currently viable during the pandemic. Ex: App  <a href="https://onenight.com/"> One Night</a> which offers discounted, last minute hotel bookings. Centrally located guide within the app features a 24 hour guide to events and activities happening in and around the hotel. Ad copy for the guide currently reads: <em><strong>8pm: Wine O Clock. 10pm: Cut a Rug. 11pm: Laugh out Loud.</strong></em> This does not align with the reality of what the current experience will be and <strong>completely misses the opportunity</strong> to acknowledge the pandemic and <strong>show users that they are cared for.</strong> It may also lead to confusion around safety protocols.<strong> This is a communication fail.</strong> The current reality may be grim, but if products are going to evolve, they need to acknowledge and respond to the current situation. We need to collectively move away from a <strong>reactive state</strong> toward a <strong>planning and responding state.</strong></p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:20:09">
<p><strong>The Umami Theory.</strong> This concept comes from a recent <a href= "https://nemesis.global/memos/umamimemo/"> memo </a> from <a href="https://nemesis.global//"> Nemesis,</a> a consulting firm founded by Emily Segal and Martti Kalliala. The essence of the memo is that we've been coasting on this experience economy which lacks depth and is centered around <strong>surface desire rather than actual desire.</strong> This is a core part of social media's success - apps like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram sell the promise that you control and curate your online persona or brand, <strong>when actually they are selling you.</strong> This matters because <em>surface desire and the lack of depth feels connected to the way Ashley feels when discussing bad user experience.</em> The user/human needs to be considered across the whole product journey. If a product's problem is that it's not human enough, you can't solve that if the product was not created for a UX/HX to begin with.</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:22:15">
<p><strong>2020's Reckoning.</strong> Ashley wants to ground us back into 2020 and meditate on what this year is forcing us to reckon with. This year has shown us how fragile and broken our existing systems are. This applies to both the products that we rely on and the ways in which we engage with each other. This is almost like a process of therapy; our <strong>society, brands,</strong> and <strong>products</strong> are <strong>being tested</strong> and <em>those willing to receive help and to change are the ones ready for the <strong>truth.</strong>The ones founded on lies may not survive.</em></p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:23:15">
<p>We can't keep pretending that our products are used by humans in an ideal state. Ex: Iphone users. Those who use iphones are not living in an ideal world, but iphone has tended to be responsive in adapting to changing UX/HX needs. <strong> If we want to create products for people who are living in reality, we have to acknowledge that our products are embedded into the human experience.</strong> Additionally, <strong>the writing</strong> that helps get us from point A to point B within a product needs to acknowledge that. It is no longer possible nor sustainable to talk to people as if they are robots or treat them as children.</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:24:01">
<p><strong>Products that are beyond branding.</strong> As we move forward to a world beyond Covid-19, we need to envision the future, and we need to imagine that we will see shifts in the ways that we understand what humanization means, in products and in the ways we relate to one another. (Ex: the way we wear masks to show others that we care about their health. Ashley is located in NYC and is seeing systems of care emerging that we aren't necessarily used to in the west due to relentless individualism.) Ashley envisions a future where products are designed around humans not because of empty branding associations but because <strong>the products need to actually work.</strong> Some features of such products might be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mindful of the human experience.</li>
<li>Challenge capitalist desires for wealth, power.</li>
<li>Centre the human and their relationship to the product.</li>

<p><strong>Concluding Thoughts!</strong> When thinking about the difference between UX writing and HX writing in the future, Ashley is thinking of HX writing as <strong>acknowledging the human using a given product</strong> as opposed to UX writing which tends to use generic terminology and jargon that maintains distance. The <strong>language of empathy, emotion, and compassion</strong> is not absent from UX conversations and spaces but it <strong>needs to be leveled up to acknowledge the societal narrative that a product is a part of.</strong> This is extremely important. <strong>Products do not exist in bubbles,</strong> they are used by people across all walks of life. As a writer, Ashley is particularly going to be thinking around the intention behind communication - <strong>what does it serve</strong> and how it can be <strong>more meaningful and impactful.</strong></p>

<h2>Machine Learning for Product Managers</h2>
<h3>Matt Travers & Matt Kelcey - Product Principal and Principal, Machine Learning, <a href= "https://www.thoughtworks.com/"> ThoughtWorks </a></h3>
<strong><em>Keywords: Machine Learning, User Experience, value creation, efficiency, commodity models, bespoke models, UI, data estate, data complexity.</em></p>
<p>TL;DR: The Matts explore Machine Learning through their respective lenses of technical expertise and product management in an attempt to map the overlap between the two and what each viewpoint might bring to create a fruitful collaboration. Matt K explores what machine learning is and its current technical feasibility in terms of types of models and their relevant merits as well as correlations between levels of complexity and volume of data, particularly as these impact delivery and the teams who drive delivery. Matt T explains how and why good product managers need to ensure that customer value, usability and strategy are as much a part of the process as the technical aspects, and uses a risk/benefit analysis to compare various approaches and chart potential pitfalls vs proven success strategies.</strong></p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:00:10">
	<p>[Matt T speaking:]The genesis of this talk is that Matt T and Matt K have very different perspectives on machine learning. Matt K comes from a very <strong>technical background,</strong> whereas Matt T's background is in >strong>product.</strong> The majority of broader conversations about machine learning comes from these <strong>two perspectives,</strong> but there's not much in the middle. <em>It's either deep technical conversations, or high-level strategic discussions about how machine learning is going to change everything.</em> The Matts wanted to do a talk that looks at the <strong>overlap</strong> about what we can actually do today with machine learning with our current product.</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:01:01">
<p><strong>What we'll cover today: A look at ML through six product management lenses.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What is Machine Learning?</li>
<li>Technical Feasibility</li>
<li>Customer Value</li>
<li>Commercial Viability</li>
<li>Usability</li>
<li>Strategy</li>
<li>Delivery</li>
</ul>

</section>
<section data-startTime="00:01:16">
<p>Over to Matt K: <Strong>What is machine learning?</strong> MK: There are many hype related terms out there around ML: Is it artificial intelligence? Data Science? Artificial intelligence is a broad, almost philosophical concept and data science is a collection of roles in a company. This presentation is about machine learning and particularly a subset of machine learning that is really applicable to business. Mat sees machine learning like a toolbox. We have a collection of problems that we know how to solve given certain data sets. When presented with a problem, they reach into the toolbox to find a solution.</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:02:01">
<p>We'll start with an example to ground the conversation. Let's imagine we want to build a piece of machinery that predicts the price of a house. Two parts to this would be: The robot in the middle representative of the software we want to write. Let's call that a model. This model tries to map between things we might know about a house ex: location, materials, age and try to predict from these what a sale price might be. The question becomes: how do we do this? How do we build this software? In many machine learning use-cases, we use a technique called Supervised machine learning. So named because we train the model by giving it examples of things that we know the answer for. We collect a priori info about a set of houses,  The problem is <em>not to learn or specify the mapping</em>between these things, but to <em>give examples</em> to a piece of machinery in order that it might learn for itself. This whole premise is conditioned by the fact that we have access to this data. <strong>Different data results in a different model.</strong> This is a critical insight - much of the software we write can be deterministic, but <strong>the dependency of machine learning off a particular data set is critical to success and how things work internally.</strong></p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:03:40">
<p><strong>Technical Feasibility.</strong> MK: Let's begin by exploring some technical aspects like data sets and models. A common set of axes to begin when thinking about ML is to look at <strong>what sort of data we have</strong> and <strong>how much of it.</strong><em> How complex is your model? What capacity does it have?</em> Put another way: <strong>How big is the piece of machinery's brain?</strong> This is somewhat intuitive, but in general, there is relationship between the amount of data you have on the problem and the quality of your results. This matters because we don't ever build one piece of machinery. Not a matter of installing the machine learning model and walking away, but rather an <strong>iterative process.</strong> As we collect more data or more complex data we have the opportunity to rebuild the model in some way and ask from it more complicated questions.</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:04:46">
<p><strong>More data = better results.</strong> There are two dimensions at play here; volume and complexity. Ex: Returning to the house price model, <strong>one conception of more data is simply more rows (volume).</strong> More types of material, distance, and age. Again this feels intuitive: the more examples the better the results. The <strong>other way we can glean more data is by adding columns (complexity).</strong> More categories of differentiation can be added, ex: how many bedrooms does the house have? Does it have a pool? Results are impacted by not only how many houses you compare but also what kinds of information you have on each house.</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:05:34">
<p>On the data side, what's more interesting in terms of the relationship to product is the complexity of the model. This is <em>often driven by the complexity of the answer we are seeking.</em> It may be that the question you are asking can't be answered from the complexity of this data set. <strong>This offers lots of flexibility on the RHS/Output side to ask different questions of the data.</strong> Maybe this data (on the house) is helpful in answering: <em>How many days will it take to sell this house?</em> Or: <em>Will this house sell in the next month?</em><strong>The less complex the question the less data you need to build a model.</strong> In terms of products for machine learning, it's important to think about: <em>Can we, if needed, reframe our question? Is there a simpler version of the question we are trying to ask?</em> that gives us a better result. There is a trade-off between volume and complexity of data and the complexity of the questions you can ask.</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:06:52">
<p>It's also critical to understand there is <strong>never just a single model or one piece of software for machine learning.</strong> They end up with lots and <strong>lots of models which interact in very complicated ways.</strong> Never just one input and out output. Might have input which goes to a model which becomes output, which then becomes input for another model. <em>All the models are doing different things and have different responsibilities.</em></p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:07:25">
<p>In thinking around different models and data requirements, there is a continuum of: <em>Where does this model come from?</em> Until fairly recently, you had to build your model from scratch. But as common questions are asked of common data, <strong>models have become a commodity.</strong> Cloud services and existing models <strong>provide a commodity set of capability but don't differentiate across the market.</strong> If you have unique data or a unique question to ask of that data, you <strong>may need to build something more bespoke.</strong>This gives <strong>more flexibility,</strong> but comes at a <strong>non-trivial engineering cost.</strong>  You can also <strong>use a combination,</strong> taking a <strong>commodity model</strong> and <strong>customizing it.</strong></p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:08:31">
<p>Choices between commodity or bespoke models are further complicated by how rapidly the technology is evolving. Ex: Object recognition technology. Very common and simple to do now. Ten years ago it was inconceivable. Five years ago it was a complicated process. Now, it costs a fraction of a cent and is easily accessible via the cloud.  Interesting balance between a relatively new technology that anyone can integrate, but how do you integrate and differentiate relative to your competitors? These are questions to ask when thinking about what kind of model you need to build/use.</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:09:08">
<p><strong>Customer Value.</strong> [Back to Matt T presenting]. Returning to the matrix between volume and complexity, let's add another bubble to represent customer value. A basic tenet of product management is that PMs should always be thinking about the value they are delivering to customers. But this sometimes gets lost in the excitement around machine learning. <strong>As we increase the size and complexity of the data estate and develop the model capacity, we need to be looking for an increase in customer value that matches that investment.</strong> It's important to set a baseline from the outset.  Before even establishing a machine learning experience, <strong><em>understand what it would look like if it were a non-ML one.</em></strong> Ex: If using a recommender, use a simple rules-based system: Products in the same category at around the same price point. This gives you a baseline for measuring customer value. Often there will be a sweet spot between adding to the data estate and improving model complexity. <em>Too much data that isn't relevant or add value or over-investment in the model without a customer value correlate takes you away from this sweet spot.</em></p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:11:28">
<p>Anti-patterns to be aware of when trying to develop customer value in line with investment in the technology: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The stalled value trap:</strong> You're continuing to invest and moving across and upwards, but seeing no increase in value. At this point you should stop and solve another problem.</li>
<li><strong>The hype trap:</strong> This is common when CEOs want to see ML but overestimate its utility. Simple rules-based systems already deliver high value and a major ML investment is required to match customer value.</li>
<li><strong>The moonshot:</strong> Not so much an antipattern as it can be a valid choice, but there is no payoff until substantial investment (see: autonomous driving). Value relies on complex models and high volume and complexity of data. This strategy is high risk, with no feedback on progressing customer value.  Assess whether it is right for your organization.</li>
</ul>

</section>
<section data-startTime="00:13:27">
<p>What the Matts do advocate is a <strong>portfolio of complementary approaches.</strong> This is the <strong>most reliable path.</strong> Just as you would have a product portfolio for a set of products, it makes sense to have a set of different investment approaches.</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:14:12">
<p><strong>Commercial Viability.</strong> Let's stick with the data estate and ML model capacity axes as frames for understanding how to manage costs. <strong>Two major costs and emergent patterns to explore here (NB: Your mileage may vary!):</strong> The <em>data cost structure</em> around the x-axis (the data estate) is comprised of the <em>cost of data engineers</em> and the <em>cost of data hardware and storage.</em> Storage is cheap in early stages but the cost grows as complexity and volume increase.  The bigger cost is the people cost in terms of data engineers. Often company data is not organized or accessible and you often need to put in a big investment up front to get it into a position that is usable.</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:15:28">
<p>On the <strong>ML Model Capacity axis, compute costs</strong> can be significant but typically have gradual linear growth. Data scientists are expensive and can be explosively so during the transition from generic to custom models. Something original is high risk and high cost.</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:00:46">
<p><strong>Usability.</strong> Usability depends on the application you're building, however there is a <strong>pattern that applies</strong> to most ML-based products. Having an interface which is <strong>robust to failure.</strong> There is a challenge to developing the machine learning experience up the two axes. It's <strong>important that the UI you create reflects where you are.</strong> Ex: Youtube doesn't aim to solve the user problem of: What's the next video I should watch? But rather, augments that experience. Gives a selection of videos that <em>might</em> be relevant and mixes various alternatives so that the user can choose from the augmented experience what option they want to pursue.</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:17:56">
<p>There is an important difference between augmenting and automating. <strong>As we get more confident with the ML Experience, we can be more presumptuous in terms of the interface that we build.</strong>  Ex: The autoplay feature in Youtube automates rather than augments, confidently assumes you will want to see what it plays next.</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:18:36">
<p><strong>Strategy.</strong> One thing that makes ML exciting from a strategic point of view is the <strong>double flywheel effect.</strong> Many products show the revenue-generating flywheel of: <em>Creating a good experience - drives usage - generates revenue - improves experience - attracts more usage.</em> With ML, another layer is added through the <strong>unique data</strong> that is generated through usage. <em>Usage - generates unique data (volume and complexity) - fed in to improve experience - attracts more usage.</em> Strategically, <strong>getting there first</strong> with a machine learning product can create an <strong>unassailable competitive advantage.</strong></p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:20:04">
<p>Two main categories of ML opportunity: <strong>Value creation vs efficiency.</strong> Value creation - building a new product experience through ML technology. This creates new customer value which can be monetized (ex: voice services, self driving vehicles). The flywheel potential means there is utility in getting there first which creates some urgency, but this is also a risky strategy.  Alternatively, we can look for value opportunities around efficiency, which can reduce costs and mitigate risks (ex: process prioritization, fraud detection). More incremental progress but also more proven as a road to success.</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:21:01">
<p><strong>Delivery.</strong> [Back to Matt K.] There are a couple of patterns we see across companies both small and large which follow two axes. The horizontal axis characterizes ML in statistical terms: being <strong>descriptive, predictive,</strong> or <strong>prescriptive.</strong> <em>Descriptive</em> applies to things like dashboards: <em>a large amount of data that you want to summarize in ways that can aid humans in making decisions;</em> the distillation of complicated data. People often move from this model to a <em>predictive</em> model. You want to <em>change some levers upstream</em> in your system, change things that are happening in future. Thirdly, <em>prescriptive,</em> where you effectively <em>hand over some aspect of the business to act on your behalf.</em> These are the three core ways that complexity grows.</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:22:40">
<p>On the Y axis of complexity, we look at who is doing this. Quite common due to the technical challenges to have a single team working on the problem ('centre of excellence'). They may then grow into a cross-team or in very high tech companies the mandate may be to do this company wide.  Three vectors of note. Descriptive statistics lead to <strong>many teams doing simple things,</strong>which is <strong>inefficient.</strong> Conversely, a <strong>single team doing very complex things</strong> can <strong>silo the project</strong> and is not ideal. The ideal is a progression over time and <strong>capturing expertise</strong> not necessarily in people, but <strong>in tools and process.</strong></p>

<h2>The love triangle: Product, Data and Growth.</h2>
<h3>Albert Mai: Head of Growth - <a href="https://vero.co/">Vero.</a></h3>
<strong><em>Keywords: product team, data team, growth team, prioritization, experimentation, metrics, PIE method.</em></p>
<p>TL;DR: Albert shares his growth strategy process called PIE (prioritization, impact, ease), an upgraded version of the commonly used RICE growth formula in which he replaces the commonly used Potential metric with a more robust, useful, and measurable Prioritization axis.  Albert has implemented the PIE method at several companies he has worked for and achieved compelling results. Albert walks us through the PIE method step by step to break down the reasons it achieves results. By positioning the user at the core of the intersection between product, data, and growth, PIE circumvents common misunderstandings that hinder productive collaboration between these three functions and their teams.</strong></p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:00:28">
<p>Albert has worked around the world with various startups across a range of industries, from e-commerce to marketplace to mobile apps. He's worked in Singapore, Vietnam, and Australia. His career history has given him the opportunity to hone various skill sets, from wireframing & landing to SEO to Marketing and product-led growth (the latter of which will be today's focus).</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:01:28">
<p>Let's start with a love story! There's a saying: <em>Three's a crowd.</em> In this case we're referring to product, data, and growth. Given his background in tech and data and recent work in growth marketing, Albert has experienced a lot of pushback from product teams against growth and a lack of understanding or interest in data. They either <strong>aren't tracking data</strong> at all or are <strong>doing so inadequately,</strong> and consequently missing important information. This means that <strong>product, data, and growth teams are not working well together,</strong> mostly due <strong>misconceptions about what growth actually is.</strong></p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:02:00">
<p><strong>What Growth is not:</strong> Based on what Albert has experienced, growth is not about quick or overnight fixes, random tests that you find on the web or elsewhere, guesswork or Top of the Funnel/acquisition.</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:02:29">
<p><strong>What Growth is:</strong> Growth is about <strong>long term sustainable strategy for the whole team - the product <em>and</em> the company.</strong> It should be based on <strong>calculated and prioritized experiments based on data.</strong> Over his four year tenure at <a href="https://www.glamcorner.com.au/"> Glamcorner</a> Albert <strong>grew the company's monthly revenue by 45 percent.</strong> This is an example of growth. <strong>Growth should focus on the whole content lifecycle</strong> and <strong>full funner user journey,</strong> not just acquisition but the process from activation to retention to referral to re-activation. <strong><em>Growth should be product-led and data-driven.</em></strong>  Another example of growth Albert created at Glamcorner was <strong>growing the returning transaction rate by a factor of 5.4,</strong> meaning over half the monthly transactions were coming from returning customers. He achieved this through <strong>focusing on retention and UX,</strong> <em>not only on the website but across all channels.</em></p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:03:33">
<p><strong>Common mistakes</strong> that Albert observes in the disconnect between product, data, and growth teams are that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Decisions and priorities are based on <strong>opinions instead of facts/data;</strong> Best practice for someone else is blindly copied regardless of relevance to the product/industry at hand;</li>
<li>Product and Growth teams are siloed - growth teams are often excluded from monthly product discussions.</li>
<li>Product teams don't emphasize data or tracking to the degree they need to from the outset, meaning that down the road when they need certain metrics they have no mechanism to capture them.</li>
<li>There is a tendency to ignore either or both <strong>qualitative and quantitative data.</strong></li>
</ul>

</section>
<section data-startTime="00:04:46">
<p>Some examples: Albert worked for a client whose <strong>data files were incoherently organized,</strong> leading to a <strong>loss of trust</strong> in the information as it wasn't clearly accessible. Another client had been signing users up for over a year into a database without tracking when they joined, <em><strong>missing valuable insight</strong> into user behavioural changes over time.</em></p> 
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:05:46">
<p><strong>Three's a crowd. Four's a solution!</strong> If you <strong>insert your user at the core</strong> of the <strong>intersection between growth, data,</strong> and <strong>product,</strong> and centre your strategy around user needs, you can <strong>solve the disconnect issue.</strong></p> 
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:06:11">
<p><strong>Prioritization:</strong> <em>How to prioritize features,  projects and strategies  from a user centred perspective?</em>  First, let's look from a product perspective. Most companies are looking at objectives and the drivers that move them toward those objectives. They track these on various metrics of <strong>effort</strong> and <strong>impact.</strong> They use these to get a prioritization score. <a href="https://www.productboard.com/"> Productboard </a>, <a href="https://airfocus.com/"> airfocus, </a><a href="https://roadmunk.com/"> roadmunk,</a> and <a href="https://craft.io/"> craft </a>are the most popular prioritization software providers. <strong>Where is growth being tracked?</strong> In Albert's work, he frames growth in terms of <em>product experiments that can be translated into formats that fit the software models.</em></p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:08:19">
<p>Many companies use frameworks like ICE or RICE to come up with prioritization scores, but <strong>these are not data driven.</strong> They are based on assumptions of researchers, not users. They are also <strong>too generic</strong> and don't account for differences between industries or individual companies within the same industry. <em>How to customize this framework to make it more flexible and able to be tailored to various industries and business models?</em></p> 
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:09:33">
<p>Albert's method is to move away from a 'best practice' model to <strong>defining what each problem is</strong> that the product is trying to solve (hypothesis/problem), and a corresponding assumption on why the problem exists and what may solve it, <strong>including identifying the point of the process at which it occurs.</strong></p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:10:45">
<p>In deference to ICE and RICE, Albert calls this method: <strong>PIE: Potential x Impact x Ease.</strong> Each of these three factors are scored based on the data that specifically inform them:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Potential</strong> is scored according to data from stakeholders/market.</li>
<li><strong>Impact</strong> is scored according to metrics on the platform/device being used, page groups, and user types and stats.</li>
<li><strong>Ease</strong> is scored according to data from dev/design/content metrics.</li>
</ul>Then all these scores are <strong>processed into a master score</strong> which offers a <em>granular, rich,</em> and <em>data informed portrait of the product,</em> instead of a more common story/guesswork approach.</p> 
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:12:55">
<p><strong>Impact Value:</strong> How do you calculate these scores? First you need to: <strong>1) Define Grouping.</strong>What group does your startup specifically seek to help, and through what media?</p>
<ul>
<li>Page or screen group?</li>
<li>Device - desktop, tablet, or mobile? IOS, Android, or Web?</li>
<li>User type:supply vs demand typical of the marketplace? Or editor vs viewer like in SaaS?</li>
<li>User segment: new vs returning? Individual buyer vs brand? User group/status: 
paid vs free. Identify the buckets you want to divide your data into.</li>
	</ul>

</section>
<section data-startTime="00:13:57">
<p><strong>2) Decide Key Metrics:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Views</li>
<li>Unique visitors</li>
<li>Conversion</li>
<li>Revenue</li>
</ul>Different companies will use different metrics. Try to get a year's worth of data to ensure you have a full cycle that isn't skewed according to seasonal upticks.</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:15:12">
<p><strong>3) Calculate Impact Score.</strong>To do this, just take the score of each grouping and use the following formula: Value/ Total Value *10. To get the scoring for Potential and Ease values you can crowdsource from your team: Ex: Albert used a card asking employees across the company <em>How would you rate the potential of the following growth ideas on a scale of 1-10?</em> The card lists the following options to be scored: </p>
<ul>
<li>Individual case study landing pages</li>
<li>Vertical/industry landing pages</li>
<li>ROI Interactive Calculator</li>
<li>Competitor Comparison landing pages</li>
</ul>NB: Both the questions and the answers are generated across the whole company, not just the executive branch. This helps eliminate bias and ensure various teams are part of the process.</p> 
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:15:12">
<p><strong>Where do ideas come from?</strong> How do you decide what you want scored? <strong>Define your key metrics.</strong>  For Ex: Performance and Growth can be broken down into <em>Lagging</em> (ex: signups, form submission) or <em>Leading</em> (ex: Clicks/spend). Product and UX metrics can be <em>quantitative</em> (engagement, retention rate) or <em>qualitative</em> (session recordings, user interviews). Define which matters to you.</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:16:32">
<p><strong>Data Maturity.</strong> There are a range of software products available to help with this.: </p>
<ul>
<li>Basic (e.g. <a href="https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/">Google Analytics; </a>traffic, impact calcs)</li>
<li>Qualitative (e.g. <a href="https://www.hotjar.com/"> Hotjar,</a><a href="https://logrocket.com/"> LogRocket</a>); heatmaps, user pain points.</li>
<li>Quantitative (e.g. <a href="https://www.indicative.com/"> indicative,</a><a href="https://mixpanel.com/"> mixpanel</a>); behavioural data, validation of assumptions
Dashboarding (e.g. <a href="https://grafana.com/">Grafana,</a><a href="https://datastudio.google.com/"> Google Data Studio</a>)</li>
<li>Business Intelligence (e.g. <a href="https://mode.com/">mode,</a><a href="https://looker.com/"> looker</a>). These two are about <strong>democratizing the process</strong> and getting input from your whole team.</li>
</ul>

</section>
<section data-startTime="00:17:30">
<p><strong>Feedback Flow:</strong> Think about feedback broadly.  Many teams overly focus on Onboarding and Activation feedback, but tend to miss feedback you can glean from marketing sites that caused the activation in the first place. When product and growth teams are sharing feedback the result is a <strong>more cohesive experience for the user</strong> and minimizes potential for user overwhelm from repetitive pitches asking for feedback.</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:18:30">
<p><strong>Crowdsource ideas:</strong> At Vero, Albert made a simple form to send to teams and users soliciting their ideas. This data can then be taken and put into plotted charts accessible to the whole team so that they can see where priorities are for testing</p> 
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:19:12">
<p><strong>Results:</strong> Over the past six months, Albert has <strong>implemented weekly testing</strong> to try various strategies and achieved excellent growth results, tripling the number of user sign ups. <em>The speed of the experiments was key here;</em> the data shows a high correlation between signups and the number of experiments being run.  This is a sustainable strategy for long term growth.</p> 
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:20:19">
<p><strong>The Love Triangle (Revised):</strong> The takeaway here is that all companies should put the user at the core of what they are trying to do.  Doing this allows product, data, and growth teams to align their strategies around user impact across all stages, from acquisition to activation to retention to referral.</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:20:43">
<p><strong>To Summarize:</strong> Start with <strong>objectives.</strong> Where is the company heading and what do you want to achieve this quarter? From here, determine: what <strong>qualitative</strong> or <strong>quantitative insights</strong> you need to capture to achieve this objective? If you don't have the data to <strong>track</strong> and <strong>validate</strong> your assumptions, implement it. From that data you can plot a <strong>product roadmap</strong> that will inform future <strong>growth projects</strong> and initiatives. Once these are mapped you can start running <strong>growth experiments</strong> as a regular habit which in turn generate a feedback loop back to the insights phase.  All of this should be framed against the <strong>user journey and user needs/impact.</strong> Regularly <strong>revisit</strong> and <strong>fine-tune</strong> your ops, processes and frameworks according to the insights you glean from experiments to ensure your processes are aligned with core mission. This is particularly relevant for startups: the results of your data will lead you to create the right framework. <strong>Ultimately your success will be determined by your team, your processes and the models you are using and how well they align.</strong></p>
