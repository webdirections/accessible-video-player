<p>Side by side images of 2012 London Olympics logos. The logo on the left features four abstract, jagged, and slanted shapes that imply a freeform block letter interpretation of the numbers 2012, with two and zero on the top and one and two beneath. All four shapes are colored in uniform solid colour blocks of pale blue. The upper left shape is overlaid with the word london, written in lowercase white Klute font typeface reminiscent of graffiti. The upper right shape is overlaid with the traditional logo of the five interlocked Olympic rings in white outline. The lower two shapes are solid colour blocks with no further graphics or text.  The logo on the right features the same four shapes, but the upper left shape is coloured dark pink with pale blue striped cutouts over the top portion. The upper right shape is also dark pink, and overlaid with an abstract arrangement of three white curved outlines. The bottom left is mostly coloured dark pink with a forest green cutout element. The lower right shape is the same forest green with some abstract orange cutout elements.</p>

Underneath the text is a banner image of a young, conventionally handsome man driving a car and smiling. The perspective of the photograph is an over the shoulder view of a blurred figure holding a smartphone, as if the driver of the car is looking at us as the viewer or blurred figure. A text box is overlaid on the right side of the banner with sign up options and buttons. Below the banner are three images with text underneath. The first image is an icon of a person with a location pin behind them. This graphic is captioned: easiest way around. The second image is of the bonnet of a car in front of a smartphone icon. On the screen of the phone icon is a location pin. This graphic is captioned: Anywhere, anytime. The third image is an icon of a piggy bank with a dollar sign imprinted on it.

<p>Screenshot of uber's current landing page. The background is an image of a middle aged man sitting at a table laughing and holding a newspaper. His gaze is to the left of the screen. He sports a thick moustache. He appears to be in a cafe or office with white and blue wallpaper featuring an abstract floral design. He is wearing a blue shirt with an argyle patterned vest over top. The pattern on the vest has similar lines to the wallpaper behind him. A black horizontal bar and the top of the screen has a range of clickable menu options. A white horizontal rectangular bar is underneath the black bar and contains a row of simple icons with the following captions: earn, ride, eat, freight, business, transit, bike, fly. The icons are akin to symbols in simplicity. For example the business icon is an outline of a briefcase composed of one rectangle representing the case and a smaller rectangle on top representing the handle. A text box with black font over a solid white background is overlaid on the background image with the headline: Get in the driver's seat and get paid. A subheading in smaller font reads: Drive on the largest network of active users. A blue sign up bar in the same colour palette as the man's shirt and the wallpaper is below the headline text.</p>

<section data-startTime="00:02:01">
<p>Slide Headed Intro: Who is Ashley Hefnawy? Text block outlining Ashley's background and reaction to covid. Illustration of a typical desktop view with text reading: A writer, creative thinker, community events organizer, DJ, dancer, musician, painter, lover of email communications, cat person, joy seeker, and a sensitive soul.... this list is not exhaustive.</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:03:35">
<p>Slide titled: What is UX Writing? Sub bullets reading: The communications that help us get from point A to point B. Extremely meta. The vibe, the atmosphere, how we're feeling inside the actual product. The fastest and easiest way to make us feel smart of dumb.</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:06:12">
<p>Slide titled: Why are we talking about it today? Sub bullets reading:
Covid-19 has drastically changed everything about UX. Humanity turns to products and systems for help in times of distress. Good products that help humanity require UX that doesn't get in the way. Good UX writing relies on a product that cares about its people! Can't have good UX if the product doesn't care about its user.</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:08:03">
<p>Slide titled: The Future. Block text reading: There is no returning back to normal. Everything is different (and going to continue to evolve as this pandemic continues). Everything is getting the magnifying glass treatment, cancel culture lacks depth, and accountability is in. So how does this affect UX writing and products?</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:08:54">
<p>Slide titled: User experience versus Human experience. Block text reading: I love naming things. If I had been involved in the naming process for 'User Experience' I probably would have called it something else: Human Experience (or HX). Maybe not groundbreaking, but let's talk about why this name feels more in line with how I work as a UX writer.</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:10:00">
<p>Slide titled: UX vs HX. Underneath, a column headed: UX or simply user) and a column headed HX (or simply human). Comparative bullets under each read: UX: Very general vs HX:More Specific. UX:Lacks emotion vs HX: holistic. UX: For those unfamiliar I'm confused already vs HX: For those unfamiliar: Wow tell me more! UX: Could be anything? A dog? Something with thumbs? vs HX: Immediately feel connected, empathy. Beside the text, a cartoon illustration of a clogged hourglass.</p>

</section>
<section data-startTime="00:20:09">
<p>Slide titled: The Umami Theory. On the left, blockquote from Nemesis reading: We believe that umami has been both literally and figuratively the key commodity of the experience economy. Umami, as both a quality and effect of an experience, popped up primarily in settings that were on the verge of disintegration, and hinged on physical pilgrimages to evanescent meccas....We also believe that the experience economy is dying, its key commodity (umami) has changed status, and nobody knows what's coming next. [endquote]
Beside this another quote reading: Everything is cancelled, and it's the beginning of the end of the experience economy as we've come to know it. The emerging post-umami economy is still nebulous... Visceral desire may again rise over the paradoxical kind. In the meantime, we suggest thinking about what you wanted, why you got it, and who happens to be holding the L-Glutamate as it all comes tumbling down. And take some time to cultivate a taste for the sour, the bitter, and the straight up repulsive - the only flavours of today's reality pill [endquote]</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:22:15">
<p>Slide titled: 2020's reckoning.  A text box reads: Writing for products with the human experience in mind is how we access the truth.  Additional text reads: Our society, our products, our brands that we know and love, are all being put through therapy... The ones that are ready to receive help, willing to change, are the ones that are ready for the truth - while the ones that are founded on lies may not survive.</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:24:01">
<p>Slide titled: Products that are beyond branding. Sub-bullets read: Mindful of the human experience. Challenge capitalist desires for wealth, power. Centre the human and their relationship to the product. Don't rely on brand associations. Don't develop codependent relationships with the humans that use them. In parentheses (see: smartphones). Help us be better humans to ourselves and to each other.</p>
</section>
<section data-startTime="00:27:21">
<p>Slide titled:Concluding Thoughts. Underneath, a column headed: User Experience Writing and a column headed Human Experience Writing. Comparative bullets under each read: UX writing uses generic terminology that maintains distance versus HX writing which acknowledges the human using a given product. UX writing creates a barrier between you and your product vs HX writing which also acknowledges the societal narrative that a product is a part of.  UX writing feels like jargon vs HX writing which forces us to ask the intention behind communication.</p>

Value creation is defined as: creates new customer value which can be monetized. Examples are voice services, self driving vehicles. The competitive advantage of value creation is the potential for flywheel. The Timing is to explore urgently. The likelihood of success is risky or moonshot. Alternatively, efficiency is defined as reducing or mitigating costs through efficiency. Examples of this are process prioritization, fraud detection. The competitive advantage of efficiency is incremental and replicable. The timing is to build gradually. The likelihood of success is more proven.</p>
