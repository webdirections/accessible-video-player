		<p><span data-startTime='00:00:00'>(upbeat music) </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:10'>- Hi, I'm Mark. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:00:12'>Today, I'm here to talk to you about design systems. </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:17'>There's a lovely German word, </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:20'>zeitgeist. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:00:21'>You've probably heard of it. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:00:22'>It means the spirit of the time. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:00:24'>Design systems are probably and have been the exact guys </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:28'>for a little while now, involved in product design. </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:31'>But in this talk, I'd like to discuss how we move away </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:34'>from the prescriptive, constrictive sameness </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:38'>in our design systems and towards more creative potential </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:42'>human approach. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:00:44'>First so, I'd like to talk to you </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:45'>a little bit about Manchester. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:00:48'>So I grew up in Manchester. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:00:50'>I haven't lived there for a long time now, but it's </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:53'>it looks a little bit like this. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:00:55'>I grew up a little bit outside of Manchester, </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:57'>but there are plenty of streets that look like this </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:00'>black and white raining all the time. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:01:03'>One thing is, pretty true of Manchester throughout </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:06'>the years, though it's a home of great music </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:08'>and has been for decades. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:01:12'>I grew up, like I say, around the 80's in Manchester </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:16'>around that time, I was old enough to go </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:18'>into Manchester on own as a young kid. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:01:23'>And around 1989 there was this thing called Manchester. </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:29'>A truth be told, a lot of people took a lot of drugs. </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:33'>And there was one guy who was very central </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:38'>in Manchester and Manchester culture. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:01:41'>I remember seeing him on TV. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:01:43'>He was a TV reporter to begin with. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:01:46'>And then he turned into a local kind of entrepreneur. </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:48'>He was pervasive. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:01:50'>He was kind of everywhere throughout my childhood, </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:53'>on TV and the things that he produced </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:56'>and things that he worked on, his name was Tony Wilson. </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:59'>And he started off as a TV reporter for the local news. </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:03'>I remember seeing him on the middle of in more than </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:07'>than this sideways rain and he's talking to some farmer </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:11'>or rather, you know, he was just somebody you saw on TV. </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:16'>He then founded Factory Records. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:02:20'>Now you may have heard of Factory Records, </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:21'>you may not have but you almost certainly will have seen </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:25'>and heard the output from Factory Records, </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:28'>Happy Mondays, New Order. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:02:32'>So this local record company hired local designers, </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:39'>local freelance designers to produce a lot of the artworks. </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:42'>And this stuff was everywhere in Manchester. </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:45'>There was a time where, you know, this record label </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:49'>was so prolific, not just the records themselves, </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:54'>but stickers on lamp posts, flyers through your door. </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:00'>As a design student in Manchester, </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:03'>in the early 90's, I was taught by some of the designers </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:07'>who had worked there, you know being a freelance record </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:11'>designer, print designer doesn't pay terribly well. </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:14'>So a lot of these people you know, taught on, </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:17'>on design courses and this work like I said, </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:20'>this was everywhere. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:03:21'>This was being taught to young designers. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:03:24'>Designers were emulating this work. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:03:26'>And it kind of became this, DNA of the city right? </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:31'>This, on every lamp post, there was this feeling, </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:36'>this hyperlocal sense of what it was </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:41'>like to be in and of Manchester. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:03:44'>That was the zeitgeists of the time, I like to call it </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:50'>something else. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:03:51'>I like to call it a thingness. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:03:53'>There was a thingness about Manchester, and it wasn't </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:55'>it couldn't be really described as, a single thing. </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:59'>It was lots of little things that made up it to to feel like </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:05'>Manchester while you were there, </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:06'>which is quite unique to any of the city that I'd been to. </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:12'>Why am I telling you this? </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:13'>Well, to me, the goal of a design system </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:17'>is to create a thingness. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:04:20'>It's a, a design system really is a connectedness </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:23'>between products, content, services. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:04:27'>It's a described system. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:04:31'>So a little while ago, in fact last year, </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:34'>I was giving a talk on design systems, </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:37'>and I asked people of, Twitter. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:04:41'>You know, if I was a senior manager </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:43'>and I was being asked to fund a design system project </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:46'>what are the pros and cons? </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:48'>What are the costs and benefits? </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:52'>You know as you might expect, I got a lot of replies. </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:54'>I got a lot of positive responses about sustainability </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:00'>and then how it enables scale, the reuse of code, </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:04'>time-saving, shed resources. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:05:07'>You know, there are a lot of advantages, </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:10'>a lot of good reasons why you should have more. </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:13'>Equally, there are a lot of, </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:17'>though I won't say it was griping </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:18'>but there were a lot of negative comments as well. </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:21'>So the fact that our technology moves very quickly </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:24'>and there could be obsolete. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:05:26'>The ongoing commitment, designs systems are our products </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:31'>and there is considerable time and money needed </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:35'>to be invested with really hard to come </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:38'>to demonstrate a clear ROI as well. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:05:42'>So there are lots of disadvantages. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:05:45'>We probably know all of these, one thing that came through </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:48'>in the positives, the parts came through more loudly </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:53'>and clearly than anything else was this idea </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:56'>of consistency right? </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:59'>Design systems solve the consistency problem. </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:03'>And they enable scale, reach and the shared vocabulary </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:10'>between people, </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:12'>between teams, </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:14'>and then they enable conversations about standards. </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:20'>They surface organisational issues, </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:23'>you know, they can be a driving force </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:25'>for a lot of change within an organisation. </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:29'>But there are challenges. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:06:31'>And we probably are aware of a lot of those challenges </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:33'>those are sort of worked with them for a little while. </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:37'>A couple of weeks ago, </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:38'>Ethan Marcotte a really great talk for a CID CSS. </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:45'>And it really resonated with me and, like him, he talked </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:48'>about a scenario that he seen in design system teams. </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:54'>And I've seen this too, a lot of the past decade or so. </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:58'>I'd like to just walk you through what he said </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:00'>and see how this resonates with you. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:07:02'>So here we are, we have a design system, </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:06'>of the core of our organisation and around it, </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:10'>in those grey circles are our product teams. </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:14'>You know, we've got a bunch of product teams or however, </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:16'>the organisation is structured regardless </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:19'>they're the consumers of the system. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:07:22'>So these are the folks who who take the components, </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:26'>and the rules of the system and apply it </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:29'>for their customers or users. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:07:34'>The products and people are served by this system. </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:37'>So let's take this example of them. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:07:39'>You know, there's a centrally produced component </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:42'>in this case, like an accordion, right? </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:44'>Something like that. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:07:45'>Every team takes and uses as this accordion, </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:49'>brilliant works very well. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:07:51'>It does exactly what, you know </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:52'>a lot of those benefits written in green </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:54'>that I was talking about earlier. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:07:57'>But then as time goes by, one of those teams discovers </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:04'>that they actually need the accordion to do something </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:07'>slightly different. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:08:10'>So they go to the design systems team and they say, </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:15'>"We need a slightly different accordion right? </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:17'>Because the one that you've given us whilst it's great, </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:20'>we need it to do something slightly different." </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:23'>The design system team says, "Actually, okay, great, fine. </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:27'>But we need to go through this process </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:29'>of collaboration in order to make another record DNN </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:34'>because we have to make that available for everyone else. </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:36'>Kindly just get by with the one that we've got, you know </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:39'>maybe change a colour or something. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:08:41'>Add a couple of icons you know, </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:42'>that scope within the design pattern to do that." </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:46'>The product team are not willing to do that. </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:50'>They, think that they need something pretty different. </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:53'>So what did they do? </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:55'>They go ahead and fork it. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:08:56'>They just create their own pattern, why? </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:01'>Because it's faster and it's easier. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:09:04'>And when the pressure of shipping, the pressure of, </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:09'>of actually the bottom line for an organisation </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:13'>is in question then you know, the design system team's needs </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:20'>are actually a lower priority than getting this </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:22'>thing out at all. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:09:24'>So, there's another team over here, team C </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:28'>as I like to call it. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:09:30'>And they have an accordion as well, </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:33'>though slightly different, </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:34'>slightly different to the one provided </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:36'>by the design systems team and slightly different again </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:39'>to the one, I think of a product team. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:09:41'>So what did they do? </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:43'>They fork it and they produce another. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:09:46'>Of course they do. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:09:48'>So we're getting this position where we have </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:50'>a design system. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:09:51'>We have one accordion. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:09:52'>We have a slightly different accordion, </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:54'>or we have another accordion. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:09:56'>Now you may be, you know, if you've worked in design systems </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:00'>before you may be nodding along </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:01'>as I'm as describing this, as Ethan said, </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:06'>you know it's my experience as well, that this is normal </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:10'>and natural, don't panic. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:10:14'>This is why collaboration is so important. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:10:16'>And whether the processes of collaboration </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:19'>around design systems is so important to smooth the way </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:23'>for acceptions and additions </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:25'>to those centrally provided patterns. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:10:30'>So with consistency being the issue, </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:34'>and the driving motivation behind design systems. </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:39'>We have two product teams at the side here </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:42'>and the design system sits in the middle. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:10:45'>It tries to strike a balance between one product team's </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:48'>needs and another product team's needs, </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:51'>with a compromised best fit solution. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:10:57'>But this proliferation of forked components will continue. </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:01'>It's just human nature, </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:03'>for us to want to create slightly different things. </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:07'>How can we provide this consistency whilst </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:10'>this is happening, </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:12'>by controlling the usage of the system, by policing it, </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:16'>by coming down hard on those who deviate or do we document </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:21'>what people are doing with it </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:22'>and we pave the cow paths that way. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:11:26'>Jeremy Keith talks about this as a system </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:30'>that is prescriptive, a prescriptive design system. </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:34'>One that is defined centralised and controlled. </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:40'>One where patterns and rules </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:42'>and usage like language are tightly defined </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:46'>centrally and controlled centrally. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:11:50'>There's a other system which he outlines, </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:54'>which is a descriptive design system. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:11:58'>Now this is one that is emergent, </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:59'>one that is being created. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:12:01'>One that is built over time, paving those cow paths </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:05'>as people, fork components and, </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:11'>the design system team then just builds on top of them. </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:17'>But that is another I think, that is another system </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:20'>beyond these two. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:12:22'>And I think it's an enabling system. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:12:24'>I think it's one that is looser, it empowers teams. </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:29'>It allows for this creativity. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:12:31'>Remember that is a natural sort of human process. </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:35'>More importantly, I think it creates this thingnes </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:40'>this sense of connectedness </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:42'>between elements in a design system. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:12:47'>The good news is, for us as designers is </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:50'>this has been done before, quite a few times, </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:54'>I'm now going to talk through two examples here. </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:56'>And they both happen to be Olympics, </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:00'>the identity systems for two different Olympics over, </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:03'>over a few decades. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:13:05'>Why am I talking about stuff that isn't digital? </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:10'>Well, I think that we have a duty as designers to look </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:13'>beyond our own fields, as to draw inspiration </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:19'>and to see where this has worked and what hasn't worked </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:21'>in other design disciplines and Olympics are almost </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:26'>unparalleled in the scale of application. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:13:30'>Yes, they're consumer focused. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:13:32'>They're also B2B focused and they cover everything </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:36'>from print and identity design, to architecture, to signage </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:41'>to fashion and clothing, to iconography and typography. </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:46'>They cover the whole gamut. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:13:51'>So the first example I'm gonna talk through with you, </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:53'>is the 2012 London Olympics. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:13:57'>An Olympics of course with my kind of a home Olympics, </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:01'>and it was incredibly divisive as a design system </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:06'>a little bit like as we say in the UK it was Marmite system. </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:11'>So you either loved it or you hated it. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:14:14'>Of course the logo was, core and central to that hatred. </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:22'>But I think it's a system </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:27'>that was far reaching unambitious, </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:30'>and it was derived centrally from the logo </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:33'>and spread out across all material. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:14:37'>The logo was designed by Wolff Olins </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:39'>and the overall branding was by FutureBrand. </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:44'>Central to the system was the fractal grid. </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:48'>It was the starting point for almost all things </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:52'>within the system. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:14:53'>It was derived from the logo and the grid became this </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:57'>tool to make the design decisions with. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:15:02'>So here you can see it applied to the seating in the arena </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:06'>which created these kind of random fractal-like random </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:12'>shapes within the seating. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:15:14'>Now to look at these, you know, on face value you wouldn't </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:18'>necessarily draw that connection between the logo </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:22'>and the seats, but they were used here </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:26'>for planning wayfinding signage. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:15:28'>So overlaid over a perspective, drawing to give odd </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:34'>structures to the supporting struts there </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:37'>or the shapes of the signage itself. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:15:41'>Now when these were then manufactured no to a wayfinding </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:46'>kind of beacon or posts look the same, </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:49'>they were all different. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:15:51'>And it gave rise to these very kind of obscure objects, </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:55'>throughout the Olympic park. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:16:00'>But even Mundane things such as tickets here, </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:03'>the ticket designs, the iconography and the colorways. </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:08'>They felt like they were connected to the system because </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:11'>in there is the fractal. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:16:14'>It's the fractal grid is underpinning it. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:16:16'>And then there were these odd moments of calm and joyful </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:20'>branding within the system as well. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:16:23'>This is the walk around the Olympic park, you basically </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:27'>follow the butterflies but these fractal sharp edges derive </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:32'>from the grid, pull everything together, visually </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:35'>and physically within the space that created the sense </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:39'>of thingness from the centre out. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:16:47'>Another example would be the, the 1972 Munich Games. </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:54'>This is an original poster of the Torch Relay. </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:57'>That's actually hanging up over there in my wall, </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:59'>in my studio. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:17:01'>It's, really large as well. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:17:03'>It's like a zero size. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:17:08'>The system that was created for the 72 Olympics </span> <span data-startTime='00:17:13'>was hung on this central idea that it's this is a cheerful, </span> <span data-startTime='00:17:18'>joyful games. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:17:20'>Otl Aicher was the man at the centre of the design system. </span> <span data-startTime='00:17:26'>Munich was spring boarding off the Mexico Games </span> <span data-startTime='00:17:30'>and the Tokyo Games, which were incredibly successful. </span> <span data-startTime='00:17:34'>And he and the German Olympic committee were really keen </span> <span data-startTime='00:17:40'>to demonstrate that the Germany was a very different place </span> <span data-startTime='00:17:43'>to a couple of decades ago. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:17:45'>It was a vibrant democratic, modern country </span> <span data-startTime='00:17:50'>and the system was a celebration of it. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:17:54'>So it was not defined centrally from a simple component, </span> <span data-startTime='00:17:59'>such as the fractal grid and the, from the 2012 games. </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:04'>This was considered much more holistically. </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:08'>The system that was developed were wonderfully </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:11'>named department, they were called Department 11 </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:15'>and there was maybe 80 or so people in there with a huge </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:19'>multidisciplinary team. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:18:21'>And it was very holistically designed in its nature. </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:23'>You know, everything from postcards, to the icons, </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:25'>to the programmes and tickets, </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:28'>they were considered as a whole. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:18:30'>Even down to this weird little dog called Waldi, </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:34'>you can actually see Waldi's not really big, </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:35'>they're like a wooden toy that you can buy </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:40'>I've yet to get hold of one. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:18:41'>You can get a lot the real collectibles around the games </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:46'>because these were produced. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:18:47'>It was just so much produced right? </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:49'>The Olympic games then poster on my wall is produced </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:52'>on a really terrible thin paper. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:18:55'>Like it's, you know, it's throw away. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:18:57'>It was designed to just be thrown in the bed </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:59'>after the games. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:19:01'>So it's amazing, but quite a lot of it survived considering </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:04'>the despite the graphic design quality </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:07'>and the branding quality </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:08'>and the system design quality, actually the material </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:12'>it was printed on was pretty poor. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:19:16'>So, the system even, you know, like the London Games even </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:21'>went down to the, to the architecture, </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:24'>and landscaping, again, the seats featured, </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:28'>and again there was weird clothes for the volunteers </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:32'>the height of 1972 fashion here. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:19:37'>So, Otl Aicher talked about </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:42'>his system for creating his material, </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:47'>in a really interesting way. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:19:49'>He said, "The system was strictly designed, </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:52'>had a strictly designed grammar but then allow for plea </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:57'>of free playful expression." </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:59'>I really liked that phrase. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:20:02'>I really liked that it's a strictly designed rules, </span> <span data-startTime='00:20:07'>but there's enough freedom within those rules to allow </span> <span data-startTime='00:20:12'>for that deviation, for that human expression whilst keeping </span> <span data-startTime='00:20:19'>a connectedness between anything that's produced. </span> <span data-startTime='00:20:24'>The way that I like to describe this is that simple </span> <span data-startTime='00:20:27'>easily communicable rules allowing for human expression. </span> <span data-startTime='00:20:34'>How can we do that in our design systems? </span> <span data-startTime='00:20:38'>Our digital design systems of today no matter what </span> <span data-startTime='00:20:41'>we we're producing them for? </span> <span data-startTime='00:20:43'>How can we allow for that human expression? </span> <span data-startTime='00:20:47'>I've been thinking about this a little while </span> <span data-startTime='00:20:48'>for a little while. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:20:49'>And the projects I've been working on recently </span> <span data-startTime='00:20:51'>is really helped me pull together some thoughts. </span> <span data-startTime='00:20:56'>So I think one of them is to articulate the design space. </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:03'>So in type of design, </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:05'>this is why I mentioned that I'm working on a project </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:07'>at the moment related to type design. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:21:10'>So typefaces are designed </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:11'>within this thing called the design space. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:21:15'>So an example of this would be, you know </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:17'>you have a bold type face going to a very thin type face </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:23'>and that is an axis of kind of boldness or weight. </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:28'>Then you might have another, which is slant. </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:31'>So going from straight to, italics or a blicked </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:37'>and then you can have another, which is the width. </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:39'>So very compressed, very extended. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:21:43'>Now, if you take those three axes, and you create a 3D </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:50'>cubeish thing from it, </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:55'>and that is a, really useful model, </span> <span data-startTime='00:22:00'>within which design decisions can happen. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:22:04'>Now type designers have been doing this for decades. </span> <span data-startTime='00:22:07'>This is how they, conceptualise and they produce </span> <span data-startTime='00:22:12'>their type faces is through instances </span> <span data-startTime='00:22:17'>and subsequent interpolations within this space. </span> <span data-startTime='00:22:23'>For the 2012 games, all design decisions existed </span> <span data-startTime='00:22:28'>within this design space, within the fractal grid. </span> <span data-startTime='00:22:34'>This helps with one critical question that comes up when </span> <span data-startTime='00:22:38'>you deviate, or when you want to deviate from a design </span> <span data-startTime='00:22:42'>system that is prescriptive. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:22:45'>One that is not described as Jeremy calls them. </span> <span data-startTime='00:22:50'>The question is, what does this look like? </span> <span data-startTime='00:22:54'>So the challenge with that, is that anything that goes </span> <span data-startTime='00:22:57'>outside of the design system, </span> <span data-startTime='00:23:00'>not operating within a design space is a challenge </span> <span data-startTime='00:23:06'>because those decisions are subjective. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:23:08'>Those are decision subjective from the designer, </span> <span data-startTime='00:23:12'>to the stakeholder or client. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:23:15'>And then it becomes about this back and forth. </span> <span data-startTime='00:23:18'>The dance of justification around why something should look </span> <span data-startTime='00:23:22'>the way it should as opposed to the system. </span> <span data-startTime='00:23:26'>I've tried to do this a few times. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:23:28'>So I've tried to articulate a design space </span> <span data-startTime='00:23:31'>in a few projects I've worked on, </span> <span data-startTime='00:23:32'>going back quite a few years now, </span> <span data-startTime='00:23:34'>I did some work with CERN, their physics laboratory </span> <span data-startTime='00:23:38'>in Switzerland, those ones who've discovered </span> <span data-startTime='00:23:40'>the Higgs boson yes those, they wanted a new website, </span> <span data-startTime='00:23:45'>and we did a bunch of work with them to try to articulate </span> <span data-startTime='00:23:50'>this design space. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:23:52'>What does it mean to the different audiences of CERN, </span> <span data-startTime='00:23:56'>how they're perceived or how their content is perceived </span> <span data-startTime='00:23:58'>and read and understood how they present themselves. </span> <span data-startTime='00:24:02'>And a lot of people compared what CERN do to NASA, right? </span> <span data-startTime='00:24:08'>NASA explores the universe and outer space and CERN </span> <span data-startTime='00:24:15'>explores inner space, explores that </span> <span data-startTime='00:24:18'>super power atomic level. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:24:21'>The challenges is that NASA has it really easy </span> <span data-startTime='00:24:26'>'cause there are pictures like this, right? </span> <span data-startTime='00:24:28'>They have astronauts and spaceships and the earth rise </span> <span data-startTime='00:24:32'>and CERN don't have that. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:24:35'>They have other things. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:24:37'>So they have visualisations of the collisions that happen </span> <span data-startTime='00:24:42'>within the Large Hadron Collider, </span> <span data-startTime='00:24:44'>and they look something like this. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:24:46'>So this was a, critical moment in our point of trying </span> <span data-startTime='00:24:50'>to articulate what a design system would look like, </span> <span data-startTime='00:24:53'>if it was based around this idea of what is wondrous </span> <span data-startTime='00:24:59'>about the work that CERN do, when we're holding them </span> <span data-startTime='00:25:03'>up to the same level as NASA, </span> <span data-startTime='00:25:06'>and this is the kind of stuff. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:25:09'>So those they add some just amazing visualisations. </span> <span data-startTime='00:25:13'>And what we did is we tried to articulate this design space </span> <span data-startTime='00:25:17'>in an easy way, so that we could answer the question. </span> <span data-startTime='00:25:22'>Okay what does this look like? </span> <span data-startTime='00:25:26'>So here right down, we have a graph of, at the bottom </span> <span data-startTime='00:25:30'>there are four main identified kind of audience </span> <span data-startTime='00:25:33'>user segments for the certain website, scientists, </span> <span data-startTime='00:25:36'>educators, students, and the general public. </span> <span data-startTime='00:25:40'>And then mapped onto that, is this idea of comprehension. </span> <span data-startTime='00:25:45'>So if you're a scientist, you have a very high comprehension </span> <span data-startTime='00:25:49'>of the work that CERN does. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:25:50'>You understand it. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:25:52'>Chances are that you're involved. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:25:55'>The general public however, has a very really low </span> <span data-startTime='00:25:58'>understanding of particle physics. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:26:02'>So what we can do to map on top of that, </span> <span data-startTime='00:26:06'>is this access that we call wonder. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:26:09'>And if for the general public, you have very very low </span> <span data-startTime='00:26:12'>comprehension of the physics, but you love pretty pictures, </span> <span data-startTime='00:26:16'>likely that's, it's like NASA. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:26:17'>You love those pictures, but you don't wanna hear </span> <span data-startTime='00:26:20'>they don't want to see the hardcore science. </span> <span data-startTime='00:26:23'>Interestingly, the inverse is true for scientists. </span> <span data-startTime='00:26:27'>They don't wanna see the pretty pictures </span> <span data-startTime='00:26:29'>but they want the real hardcore science facts that work. </span> <span data-startTime='00:26:33'>So we can use the scale then. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:26:36'>And we plotted points of the, the website and the digital </span> <span data-startTime='00:26:41'>products that we were working on against the scale. </span> <span data-startTime='00:26:44'>And it determined what things look like, how they deviated </span> <span data-startTime='00:26:48'>from the system and how we could create the system to allow </span> <span data-startTime='00:26:51'>for those deviations. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:26:53'>So things like that home page, have these big images. </span> <span data-startTime='00:26:56'>And that's because it was over on the general public </span> <span data-startTime='00:26:58'>it's served the broadest audience. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:27:01'>So the wonder was high, but comprehension was low. </span> <span data-startTime='00:27:04'>The inverse to that was this a certain directory. </span> <span data-startTime='00:27:08'>So this was one of the very first web pages ever made </span> <span data-startTime='00:27:12'>'cause the, worldwide web was made at CERN. </span> <span data-startTime='00:27:15'>One of the first pages was a directory. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:27:18'>That's basically just a big list of all the stuff. </span> <span data-startTime='00:27:21'>And it hadn't been redesigned in like 20 years. </span> <span data-startTime='00:27:24'>And we were unfortunate enough to redesign it. </span> <span data-startTime='00:27:27'>A lot of people hate us for the work that we did on this, </span> <span data-startTime='00:27:29'>but as you can see, right? </span> <span data-startTime='00:27:31'>It's, links, it's low wonder. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:27:33'>It's, purely functional in it's approach. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:27:39'>So you know, high comprehension, low wonder. </span> <span data-startTime='00:27:44'>My previous job I was actually still in science, </span> <span data-startTime='00:27:47'>I worked at the European Molecular Biology Lab for a couple </span> <span data-startTime='00:27:51'>of years leading that digital team. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:27:53'>And we tried to similar thing, there were some similarities </span> <span data-startTime='00:27:57'>but some not. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:27:58'>And we tried a whole bunch of different models, </span> <span data-startTime='00:28:03'>and they just wouldn't stick, right? </span> <span data-startTime='00:28:05'>Nobody you know as well as the digital team understood them. </span> <span data-startTime='00:28:08'>You know, even some of the broader service teams </span> <span data-startTime='00:28:11'>who would use the design system got it. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:28:13'>They understood what we were trying to do. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:28:15'>A lot of the stakeholders were just not getting it </span> <span data-startTime='00:28:18'>not, digging it. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:28:19'>So we tried a bunch of different ways </span> <span data-startTime='00:28:22'>to articulate this design space. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:28:24'>In the end, it came down to one thing, </span> <span data-startTime='00:28:27'>which was this volume knob idea. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:28:30'>So we've all seen spinal tap, right? </span> <span data-startTime='00:28:33'>It goes all the way up to 11, but this idea that we could </span> <span data-startTime='00:28:36'>tune up or down several axes, </span> <span data-startTime='00:28:42'>those axes in particular were colour, layering and imagery. </span> <span data-startTime='00:28:48'>And we could go through a product or a website </span> <span data-startTime='00:28:53'>or a service application or we could say right </span> <span data-startTime='00:28:58'>on a scale of one to five on our volume knob, </span> <span data-startTime='00:29:02'>what is this? </span> <span data-startTime='00:29:04'>So colour? </span> <span data-startTime='00:29:05'>Is this a one or is this a five? </span> <span data-startTime='00:29:07'>And you know, we just map those across those axes. </span> <span data-startTime='00:29:13'>And that will give us kind of a ranking, </span> <span data-startTime='00:29:15'>you know we'd add those up. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:29:16'>Like the top one there, </span> <span data-startTime='00:29:17'>they add up to four, it's pretty low. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:29:20'>So it will determine how the feeling and the component </span> <span data-startTime='00:29:27'>that the system used, </span> <span data-startTime='00:29:28'>it would determine the design there. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:29:33'>So a couple of examples here, right? </span> <span data-startTime='00:29:34'>This is the home page. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:29:36'>You can see, it's kind of dialled up in a lot of ways. </span> <span data-startTime='00:29:39'>This is the shop window for the website. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:29:43'>So as you can see here, there's the annual report. </span> <span data-startTime='00:29:47'>And that's kind of dialled down a little bit, </span> <span data-startTime='00:29:49'>but it's still fairly dialled up because of the audiences </span> <span data-startTime='00:29:55'>that it, that it caters for. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:29:59'>Why this was really important was for, </span> <span data-startTime='00:30:03'>the research groups within EMBL. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:30:07'>So the research groups had their own websites, </span> <span data-startTime='00:30:09'>and in order for them to kind of adopt them </span> <span data-startTime='00:30:13'>to make them their own. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:30:16'>We had to provide different kind of sliders and options </span> <span data-startTime='00:30:20'>for them in order to allow them to be, feel creative </span> <span data-startTime='00:30:24'>to allow them to express their research groups work </span> <span data-startTime='00:30:29'>and who they were. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:30:30'>Now, some research groups would use not interested. </span> <span data-startTime='00:30:32'>They're like, "Ah, just give me a working website </span> <span data-startTime='00:30:36'>and that's all that I want." </span> <span data-startTime='00:30:37'>The other research groups just wanted to go crazy, right? </span> <span data-startTime='00:30:40'>They wanted to make something really their own, </span> <span data-startTime='00:30:43'>and actually we couldn't stop them. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:30:46'>Science organisations don't work that way. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:30:48'>They are, they have very flat hierarchically a lot of people </span> <span data-startTime='00:30:51'>doing what they want which can present some challenges </span> <span data-startTime='00:30:54'>to design systems. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:30:56'>So, as you can see here, an example over on the left there, </span> <span data-startTime='00:30:59'>that's totally dialled down ask for somebody who doesn't </span> <span data-startTime='00:31:01'>wanna do anything. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:31:02'>It's like a one on the volume scale. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:31:05'>And the one on the right there is a little, higher. </span> <span data-startTime='00:31:10'>So this idea of articulating the space, the design space </span> <span data-startTime='00:31:16'>providing those guard rails, those edges, </span> <span data-startTime='00:31:24'>of where you can deviate to. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:31:27'>Another providing that through, </span> <span data-startTime='00:31:29'>is a couple of ways you can do it. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:31:30'>You can provide it through an examples. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:31:33'>So a lot of branding systems such as the Olympics, </span> <span data-startTime='00:31:37'>they would produce a set of rules like Otl Aicher said, </span> <span data-startTime='00:31:43'>some strict grammar, type, colour iconography devices </span> <span data-startTime='00:31:49'>such as the fractal grid. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:31:51'>And then they provide a bunch of examples </span> <span data-startTime='00:31:53'>of how they'd apply it to things. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:31:55'>And then that would be a toolkit for other professions </span> <span data-startTime='00:32:00'>to say, "I can go, okay," </span> <span data-startTime='00:32:01'>And then to interpret, right? </span> <span data-startTime='00:32:03'>There should be enough of a straight grammar there for them </span> <span data-startTime='00:32:06'>to interpret and to express whatever they were doing, </span> <span data-startTime='00:32:10'>whatever meeting they were doing it in a native way. </span> <span data-startTime='00:32:14'>And we can, so we can do that digitally as well. </span> <span data-startTime='00:32:18'>The other way that we can do it is to bake those variants </span> <span data-startTime='00:32:22'>into components, right? </span> <span data-startTime='00:32:24'>We can end up with an accordion with four, five eight </span> <span data-startTime='00:32:29'>different variations, a lot of design systems do this </span> <span data-startTime='00:32:32'>at the moment to be able to accommodate those range </span> <span data-startTime='00:32:37'>of you know, the kind of the volume range of things, </span> <span data-startTime='00:32:40'>or just simply through design tokens, </span> <span data-startTime='00:32:43'>by having being able to change the background colours, </span> <span data-startTime='00:32:46'>by able to change the typography with icons </span> <span data-startTime='00:32:49'>without icons, you know, a lot of these component level </span> <span data-startTime='00:32:55'>variables can be changed. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:33:00'>I wanna leave you with a thought from another, </span> <span data-startTime='00:33:05'>kind of a hero of mine, is Bruce Lee. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:33:08'>So weirdly, so Bruce Lee, as you know martial artist, </span> <span data-startTime='00:33:12'>film star, but in his prime when he was younger, </span> <span data-startTime='00:33:17'>he broke his back. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:33:19'>And while in hospital, he started formulating ideas around </span> <span data-startTime='00:33:24'>his own style of martial arts. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:33:26'>So Bruce Lee came from a very kind of rigid style-based </span> <span data-startTime='00:33:33'>martial arts system and to him and just in many ways </span> <span data-startTime='00:33:38'>it didn't work because it only worked within the system, </span> <span data-startTime='00:33:44'>but real life isn't like that. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:33:47'>So he understood that approach to combat didn't work </span> <span data-startTime='00:33:53'>and his martial arts system is based on the realities </span> <span data-startTime='00:33:55'>of combat is based on flexibility and adaptability of what </span> <span data-startTime='00:33:59'>actually works in a given context. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:34:01'>So he, this is a lovely, a lovely quote over here. </span> <span data-startTime='00:34:04'>It buys relevance to what we're talking about today. </span> <span data-startTime='00:34:06'>"To my followers of Jeet Kune," </span> <span data-startTime='00:34:07'>that was what he named his style, </span> <span data-startTime='00:34:10'>"Know this all fixed set patterns </span> <span data-startTime='00:34:12'>are incapable of adaptability or playability, </span> <span data-startTime='00:34:15'>but truth lies outside of fixed patterns." </span> <span data-startTime='00:34:19'>So maybe the thingness, this acknowledging the deviations </span> <span data-startTime='00:34:24'>from a predefined system is a way </span> <span data-startTime='00:34:27'>to create sustainable systems. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:34:29'>And then reality of our design systems lies outside </span> <span data-startTime='00:34:35'>of predefined rigid ponderance. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:34:40'>Thank you very much. </span> </p>

		<p><span data-startTime='00:00:00'>(upbeat music) </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:11'>- Hello everyone, </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:12'>before we get started with our presentation, </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:15'>let me just tell you a small story about Gina. </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:18'>Gina is the quintessential community activist, </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:22'>and she's my friend who wants to do her bit in everything. </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:26'>Come the pandemic she started to sew, </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:29'>and sew she did about 30 odd face masks </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:33'>as prescribed by the Australian Government Health website. </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:37'>And these masks were distributed to friends and neighbours. </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:41'>Then came her first trip to the </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:42'>supermarket with the mask on, </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:45'>and she did a complete product recall from all the 25 people </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:49'>that she had distributed the mask to. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:00:52'>The problem, no breathing room. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:00:54'>The masks stuck to her face and rubbed her lipstick off. </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:58'>So, after some trials, she came up with this. </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:04'>She's very happy with the outcome now </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:06'>as a lipstick stays safe and undisturbed. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:01:09'>Funnily enough, that is exactly what </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:13'>design teams in an enterprise face every day. </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:16'>In an urgency to hit the market, </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:18'>we often go the prescribed way </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:20'>without having the time or room to question it. </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:23'>However, we don't have the luxury of Gina </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:27'>to pivot and put out a new product the very next day. </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:32'>In summary, there's no breathing room for design </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:35'>to conceive and execute a delightful solution. </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:40'>Good morning everyone, I'm Sharbani Dhar, </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:42'>design director at Australia Post, </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:45'>an enterprise that has been the backbone </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:48'>of Australia for over 200 years, and. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:01:52'>- My name is Michelle O'Reilly, </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:54'>I'm the UX design leader Australia Post. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:01:58'>- Lovely to meet you all. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:02:01'>Today, we are here to take you through a case study </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:04'>on how we've created breathing room </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:06'>for design within our enterprise. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:02:09'>It's been a journey of trial and error, </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:11'>one, we are continuously looking to improve, </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:14'>these are some of our learnings for those of you </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:17'>who are facing similar challenges. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:02:21'>But first, a few facts about us. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:02:24'>We are over 210 years old, so yes, </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:28'>our first Postmaster General Isaac Nichols </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:32'>was in fact a convict, </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:34'>transported to New South Wales for stealing. </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:37'>Nichols was responsible for collecting </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:39'>the mail from newly arrived ships </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:41'>and distributing it to the colonies. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:02:43'>From the first post office in George Street in Sydney, </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:47'>we are now about 4300 post offices, </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:51'>spread across over 7.5 million square miles. </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:57'>Our post offices are the lifeblood of rural Australia, </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:01'>they're a key enabler of e-commerce, </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:04'>and from small businesses to large enterprises, </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:07'>our customer is everybody. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:03:09'>From the tech-savvy millennial in Melbourne </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:12'>to the lady knitting baby jumpers in cable Cora, </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:16'>where the nearest town is 700 kilometres away. </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:20'>A continual insult we often hear from people </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:23'>in our research over the years is that </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:26'>when banks close, they're not so fast. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:03:29'>But when post offices close in a rural town, </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:32'>people get very worried for if they don't have </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:35'>a post office, they feel that they don't consider </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:38'>themselves a town anymore. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:03:40'>That is the level of trust </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:42'>and responsibility Australia Post shoulders. </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:46'>Last year, we sent about 3.3 billion items </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:52'>across 12.1 million addresses in Australia </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:56'>and 214 countries across the world. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:03:59'>With the onset of COVID, </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:01'>our volumes have increased to triple </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:03'>than what we normally experience during peak times. </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:07'>It takes a lot to run a network and business </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:10'>of this size and making change is hard. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:04:14'>Believe me, there are some days when we feel as if we </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:17'>are working with technology from Mr Isaak Nichols himself. </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:21'>Having a large footprint means </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:24'>we have multiple operational dependencies </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:27'>and multiple operational complexities. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:04:29'>And this has become more obvious </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:31'>than ever before, during the pandemic. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:04:36'>- As the digital team at Australia Post, </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:39'>we are the facilitators for experiences. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:04:42'>It's our job to connect customers without </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:45'>them having to come physically to us </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:47'>and allow them to easily search service online. </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:51'>Most importantly, we are the key channel of communication </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:55'>in emergencies, bush fires, floods and the pandemic. </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:01'>The digital team is more than 500 people working across </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:05'>20 engineering teams that are spread across </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:08'>four to five major programmes of work in the enterprise. </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:12'>For delivery, we follow the Scaled Agile Framework </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:15'>for enterprise or more commonly known as SAFe. </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:18'>SAFe is a framework that allows complex enterprises </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:22'>to adopt agile methodologies within our development teams. </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:26'>So that they can function in a lean manner </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:29'>where they can be nimble, agile </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:31'>and better able to react to market demands. </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:35'>In order for this to work, the whole digital team </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:38'>plans together every quarter. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:05:41'>We check in every six weeks to reassess the progress </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:44'>and planning, and we adapt to any changes. </span> </p>

		<p><span data-startTime='00:05:54'>We then map the dependencies with other teams to ensure </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:57'>whether are teams with dependencies, </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:59'>they aren't operating in silos, </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:01'>but are communicating and planning together. </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:05'>However, SAFe is a self-aware development methodology. </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:09'>It has been a constant trial and error to mould </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:11'>and shape this process to ensure these </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:14'>experienced teams' needs are also accounted for. </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:18'>Australia Post is a really large enterprise with customers </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:21'>of various digital aptitudes across the country </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:24'>with legacy tech and old school stakeholders, </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:27'>this has been a very interesting challenge. </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:29'>It's not only how do we build the software, </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:32'>but how do we design that software </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:34'>in a way that's simple, useful, </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:37'>and delightful for our customers. </span> </p>

		<p><span data-startTime='00:07:27'>This is when we decided to experiment for dual track. </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:32'>This is where discovery and delivery run parallel </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:35'>to each other without a time dependency on each other. </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:39'>While experience continues its discovery </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:42'>towards an evolving vision that teams can use </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:44'>as a beacon, delivery becomes the incremental </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:47'>realisation of that vision. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:07:51'>As part of discovery track, we kick off end-to-end </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:54'>research and design activities that could </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:57'>ideally be at least a quarter to six weeks </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:00'>in advance before delivery kicks off. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:08:02'>Once we start to uncover the insights, </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:05'>the delivery teams can then start to pick them up </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:07'>as opportunities for quick wins. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:08:10'>As the research gets more and more mature </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:12'>and findings get media delivery can then start </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:16'>to plan for bigger pieces of work. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:08:19'>Why this works? Removing time dependency </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:22'>between experience research and delivery, </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:26'>allowed further breathing room to think, unpack </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:30'>and invite cross channel collaboration. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:08:33'>Continuous slicing of learnings from research </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:36'>into smaller pieces of delivery, </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:38'>allowed delivery teams to work towards </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:40'>meaningful and viable outcomes. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:08:43'>Identifying quick wins also allowed for quick, </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:46'>not so expensive fails, while making time </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:49'>for research on more complex problems. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:08:54'>How this works? How does this really work? </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:57'>Let's look at our double diamond for a bit </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:00'>to see how it fits into dual track. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:09:03'>The first half of the diamond, learn </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:05'>is when the discovery track kicks off </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:09'>and the create half is where the delivery track kicks off. </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:13'>Learn is when we try to spend as much time as we can, </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:17'>understanding the problem, learning as much </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:19'>as we can about it, so that then we can begin to create. </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:24'>Now, when I say discovery track, I don't mean </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:27'>that this is an activity that is solely owned by experience. </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:31'>In the same way delivery track </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:33'>is not solely owned by the tech. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:09:35'>So for this to work, it is of utmost importance </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:40'>to identify the right balance </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:42'>of people for driving the right parts. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:09:46'>The participants of discovery track are therefore </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:49'>the product managers from viability, </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:52'>the software architect from tech and the design </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:54'>directors from design driving, </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:56'>the research and vision setting. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:09:59'>The participants for delivery, </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:01'>are business analysts from viability, </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:04'>the developers from tech and designers from design </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:07'>driving the delivery for an optimization. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:10:11'>Now this is important, while these two tracks run parallel </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:15'>to each other, the producers, iteration managers </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:19'>and the leads become the connectors of the two tracks. </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:23'>Having roles that work upstream rules the flow downstream </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:28'>with kind of does in the process who ensure </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:30'>that there's a constant dialogue happening between the two, </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:33'>facilitates the space and breathing room to focus </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:37'>on the right parts of the process at the right time. </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:41'>From day one, we also operated on showing full </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:45'>transparency of our processes and methods. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:10:48'>The team were unclear around UX processes, </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:51'>and we took every opportunity possible to educate </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:54'>and answer any questions they had. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:10:57'>We instigated a weekly share back </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:59'>that was an open forum for 30 minutes. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:11:03'>We would share back progress and take anyone </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:06'>that is interested on the journey, </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:08'>explaining the decisions we were making. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:11:10'>It was an open forum for collaboration, product owners, </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:14'>security experts, engineers, architects, </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:18'>business stakeholders, just about anybody could come </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:22'>and keep across the project as often as they wished. </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:25'>- Our first experiment with this new delivery approach </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:29'>was the redesign for mail redirection, </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:31'>Mail redirection is a service that allows you </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:33'>to have your mail redirected from one address to a new one. </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:37'>And it's most commonly used by people </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:39'>when they move to a new home. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:11:41'>Mail redirection is one of our most </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:43'>expensive services that we provide. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:11:46'>Unfortunately, that was the drive's </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:47'>the maximum calls in customer complaints. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:11:50'>When we kicked off the discovery truck, </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:52'>we were off with an unclear problem and an unclear solution. </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:57'>We knew that customers are complaining. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:11:59'>But that wasn't the problem, that was the symptom. </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:01'>By starting the discovery track </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:04'>it allowed us to separate the problems from the symptoms. </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:08'>To see what's really impacting our customers and our staff. </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:12'>At the same time, we found that </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:14'>30,000 customers were forced to call us, </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:17'>as they were unable to verify their identity online </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:20'>owing to special ID requirements. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:12:22'>This allowed us to identify an opportunity </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:25'>we could add towards delivery backlog. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:12:27'>We could open up servicing 85% </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:30'>of concession customers online. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:12:32'>This was a big win for our concession </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:34'>customers because they have high rates </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:36'>of disabilities and mobility issues. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:12:39'>And the cost of travelling to a post </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:41'>office for them can add significant stress to their budget. </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:45'>This has been especially helpful to customers during COVID, </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:48'>as we are allowing them more flexibility for them </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:51'>to apply to their preferred channel of choice. </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:56'>Through continuous research throughout </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:57'>the project we uncovered lots of issues. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:13:00'>However, the biggest issue was </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:02'>that we keep getting in our own way. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:13:04'>What I mean by that is, that over time people </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:08'>spotted opportunities to piggyback </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:11'>on the traffic of this product. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:13:13'>Over the years, multiple upsells slip </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:16'>their way into the flow on a road to the experience. </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:20'>During testing customers would get </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:23'>so distracted by all of these upsells </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:25'>that they would forget the original intent </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:27'>of the task they were trying to complete. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:13:29'>The solution was simple, move upsells outside the flow </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:34'>to increase overall conversion rates. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:13:37'>Most importantly, based on our research </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:39'>and analysis we were able to set up </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:42'>the right measures of success which became our criteria </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:46'>to continue optimization post delivery. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:13:49'>We use data to inform decisions and decide </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:52'>when features were suitable to be released into production. </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:57'>This helped us get big changes across the line </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:59'>and build trust with our stakeholders. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:14:02'>The project was a success, it came in ahead of schedule </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:06'>and budget, we met and exceeded all expectations, </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:09'>some of which such as the overall conversion </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:12'>for mail redirection significantly. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:14:14'>So what does this mean? </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:15'>Having the breathing room to collaborate </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:17'>and proactively work through dual track, </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:19'>has allowed us to build partnerships </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:22'>instead of receiving a list of requirements, </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:24'>establish a continuous culture of measure and learning, </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:28'>prove the value of design and experience </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:31'>to the point that now design informs strategy. </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:35'>- So all these trials or all these experiments </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:40'>what do they really mean for you who are watching? </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:45'>Creating breathing room starts with creating transparency, </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:50'>a brick and mortar enterprise, </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:52'>which has multiple operations trying to work together, </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:55'>will not always have a prescribed process. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:14:59'>But whatever process you choose </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:01'>needs to start with creating transparency </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:04'>about it for all the players involved. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:15:08'>We as design can sit in a corner </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:11'>and complain that we don't get hurt. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:15:14'>In the beginning, we were asking for a seat at the table </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:17'>without really offering a chair at our own. </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:20'>Getting out of that mindset and having partnerships </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:24'>enabled us to build and try different methods. </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:28'>A framework is good, as long as you allow </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:30'>a bit of push and pull into it. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:15:33'>To create the breathing room means not being </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:35'>a fundamentalist in agile or design thinking, </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:39'>or even design sprints or you know, service blueprinting. </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:43'>But identifying what works best for the opportunity. </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:47'>Don't drink the Kool-Aid just because the cult leader says. </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:52'>No, the different roles in an organisation work better </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:57'>at different instances of the problem solving process. </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:01'>Identify them, utilise them, but also bridge them. </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:06'>So that one role in one part of the process </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:09'>is not disconnected from the other. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:16:13'>Agree early on, regarding what metrics </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:16'>you want to deliver on. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:16:18'>Validate their relevance as part of your research </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:21'>and implement and monitor them as part of your delivery. </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:26'>Finally do not forget, it's never over. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:16:31'>It's a continuous process of improvement. </span> </p>

		<p><span data-startTime='00:00:12'>According to a study by the Nielsen Norman Group, </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:14'>when you were deciding to attend my talk, </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:16'>you would have spent 10% more time </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:18'>looking at my speaker profile than reading my bio, </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:20'>which is a little bit creepy. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:00:22'>As visual designers, </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:23'>many of our decisions, to others, </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:26'>appear as if we're just making things look pretty, </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:28'>or we're just an over obsessed designer </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:30'>that loves clean white space </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:32'>and likes particular images and colours, </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:36'>but the decisions we make with visual design </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:38'>can seriously impact a user's experience. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:00:41'>It can cause the user's brain to work harder, </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:43'>to connect the dots and process the information, </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:45'>so this can actually really help or hinder </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:47'>depending on how we design something. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:00:49'>It can help or hinder a user find their way really quickly, </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:53'>and this then can increase </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:54'>or decrease a brand's credibility, </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:56'>all of which affects the company's profits </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:59'>and the successful failure of their products. </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:02'>It takes only 150 milliseconds for the brain </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:04'>to process an image. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:01:06'>Good visual design can speed up data perception, </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:09'>help us retain data for much longer, </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:11'>it can trigger pleasure, </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:12'>it could guide our attention, </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:14'>and having a universal interface </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:15'>can make an app or website more accessible, </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:18'>especially when you're looking at something </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:20'>that's global and you're trying to deal </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:21'>with different languages. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:01:23'>Icons particularly break down that barrier, </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:27'>and 65% of the population are visual learners, </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:30'>and more than 500 million people use Instagram daily </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:33'>to take photos, comments, and post stories, </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:36'>so visual design is in our DNA and it really impacts </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:39'>the overall product experience. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:01:41'>And we've seen a lot recently with the rise </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:43'>of design sprints, MVPs, </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:45'>and just getting the idea right there, </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:47'>which is really good for us to really test </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:49'>and validate an idea and get feedback from users, </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:52'>but the visual design of a product is then often left </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:56'>to the last minute, or it never actually gets refined, </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:59'>so a lot of delivery teams don't get a chance </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:01'>to go back through a product </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:03'>due to budgets and time constraints </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:05'>to actually polish and create a better experience </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:07'>for our customers, yet 65% of the population </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:10'>are visual learners. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:02:13'>And you have just 50 milliseconds </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:15'>before a user's made the final judgements </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:17'>on a digital product. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:02:19'>So for example, SAS companies that offer free trial runs, </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:22'>their products have to convince customers </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:24'>within a very short period of time that it adds values </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:27'>and value to the customer </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:28'>and it solves one of their problems, </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:30'>'cause we don't want people to have to put </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:34'>an awful lot of effort in, </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:35'>so we need to make sure that the first instance </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:37'>of your product being released, that the user can use it </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:40'>and it's visually appealing to them as well. </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:43'>Otherwise all of that money that you spent </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:46'>delivering the product and getting it out there </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:48'>and trying to get these new customers </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:50'>is just going to go to waste. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:02:53'>A specific blue can make 80 million in revenue for Bing, </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:58'>so when Microsoft was designing </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:00'>what would eventually become Bing, </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:01'>it tested a vast number of colours with users </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:04'>to see what was more appealing to them </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:06'>and which links they were going to click on more, </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:08'>and it turned out that users engaged </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:11'>with one particular colour the most, </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:13'>and it wasn't just any shade of blue, </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:16'>it was this particular shade of blue, </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:19'>and from the research they've done, </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:21'>this is actually giving them an 18 million </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:23'>in annual revenue per year for Bing. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:03:26'>So that's the power of what a colour can do. </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:30'>So why does one colour over another </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:32'>make such an impact on the user </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:34'>and the brand value and their revenue, </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:37'>and can visual design fee to use </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:38'>their psychological state for the good or for the bad? </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:41'>So I'm going to touch on how our brains work, </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:44'>the psychological impact of design, </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:46'>and how brands are evolving digitally </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:49'>and also around the aesthetic usability effect as well. </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:54'>So we process sensory data in parallel </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:57'>as we interact with the world around us, </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:59'>and different regions of our brain </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:00'>are simultaneously activated through networks of neurons, </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:04'>and this is referred to as visual perception, </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:06'>which is essentially the brain's ability </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:08'>to make sense of what the eyes see. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:04:10'>So no matter what design we're creating, </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:12'>in the end, it's all about how our brain sees </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:14'>and understands that information. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:04:17'>So 40% of the brain nerves are connected to the retina </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:20'>and 90% of everything that comes to our mind </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:23'>is given by visual stimuli. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:04:25'>So vision is the sense that we most depend on </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:28'>in our daily lives, and it's complex. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:04:31'>Despite the huge strides in artificial intelligence </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:34'>and image processing, </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:36'>the way our brains process images is vastly superior, </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:39'>and most researchers believe </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:41'>that visual processing in the cortex </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:43'>occurs through two distinct streams of information, </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:46'>so one string is called the what pathway, </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:49'>which is shown in purple, </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:50'>and this is involved in recognising </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:52'>and identifying objects, </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:54'>and the where pathway shown in green is </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:57'>the objects that move around in their location, </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:59'>so this is really important </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:01'>for visual guide your behaviour. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:05:04'>So if we look at the hierarchy, </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:06'>so the visual cortex has a clear </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:08'>hierarchical arrangement with this information. </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:11'>So in the lower areas is where we have </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:14'>the most amount of light that comes through, </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:16'>and this gives us the very basic signals, </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:18'>so the orientation of a bar or the direction </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:21'>or the neurons respond, </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:23'>also respond to just input for one eye </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:25'>in this particular region, </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:26'>and then as we work up that hierarchy </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:29'>into the more complex areas, </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:31'>the neurons respond to more complex visual features, </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:34'>so they respond to contours and textures </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:36'>and foreground and background objects as well. </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:41'>And at the top of this information, </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:42'>it then gets split into those what and where streams. </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:46'>So the what represents complete objects. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:05:48'>There is even a part of it called the fugiform face area, </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:52'>and this specifically responds to faces. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:05:54'>And then the where, </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:55'>so this stream is involved in tasks </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:57'>like guiding the eye movements and using the working memory, </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:00'>and then this is integrating with our vision </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:04'>and our body's position. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:06:05'>So for example, when you reach for an object. </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:08'>The bottom to top processing of our visual world </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:10'>may seem like a logical path, </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:11'>but we're more complex than that. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:06:13'>The bottom up approach would be too slow and laborious, </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:16'>and would render our visual world of ambiguity </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:19'>and we'd actually struggle to survive. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:06:21'>Instead, our perception relies </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:24'>to a very large extent on previous experiences, </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:27'>and other top down mechanisms to help us with our attention. </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:32'>So we've all seen those examples </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:33'>floating around the internet </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:34'>where we've got the famous blue, grey, gold, white dress, </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:38'>depending on how you look at it </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:39'>and how your brain processes it. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:06:41'>So if we look at this example, </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:44'>square A looks lighter, </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:46'>but it's actually darker than square B, </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:48'>so our visual system is doing a terrible job </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:51'>of seeing reality, but that isn't the purpose of our brain. </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:55'>Our brains are actually trying </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:56'>to make sense of what they're seeing </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:58'>rather than trying to seek the truth, </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:01'>so we'll automatically see, based on past experience, </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:04'>light and dark squares arranged in a checkerboard fashion, </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:08'>and then we have a central lit portion </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:10'>and shadows cast around the edges, </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:13'>so with all of this information, </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:14'>we interpret A as a lighter square in shadow </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:18'>and B is a brighter light-dark square, </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:22'>but this isn't reality, </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:24'>but it is the most likely explanation </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:26'>given all of our previous experience and the data to hand. </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:30'>This is how our visual system works ultimately </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:33'>to help us understand the world and promote our survival. </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:37'>So here are the squares side by side, </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:39'>so you can see A is darker than B. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:07:43'>So our brains are constantly trying </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:45'>to make sense of what they see, </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:47'>and when we're designing anything, </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:48'>whether it be digital interfaces, software, or advertising, </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:52'>we need to reduce the visual stress </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:54'>and help user's brains process the information quicker. </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:57'>There was a huge study done by Lightspeed </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:59'>and Digital Graphic Agency, </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:01'>so they collaborated on extensive research </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:04'>where they experimented with different visual aids. </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:08'>So they conducted over 70 experiments </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:10'>and tested over 500 individual icons and charts </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:14'>and presentations and infographics </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:16'>with over 10,000 people in five different countries. </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:18'>They did a huge amount of research </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:20'>with different people in different areas, </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:23'>and they discovered when designing icons, </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:24'>the more literal the visual, the better. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:08:27'>So they, and they have to be very accurate, </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:30'>so the icons literally have to be iconic, </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:32'>and they have to be deceptive </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:34'>yet without any unnecessary detail, </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:37'>so we really need that brain </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:38'>to process the information quicker. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:08:40'>So simple one or two colour design icons </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:43'>are selected far faster than full colour, </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:45'>so if we see in this example here, </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:47'>the orange juice carton </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:48'>that's got the really nice graphics on there, </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:50'>took 33 milliseconds for the brain </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:52'>to process that information. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:08:54'>If you compare that to the nice outlined, very simple icon, </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:58'>it took our brain just 20 milliseconds </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:01'>to process the information. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:09:04'>And then if we look at this example </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:07'>of the PlayStation controller, </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:10'>so on the left-hand side, we've got the really complex icon, </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:15'>which took 19 milliseconds, </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:17'>and on the right hand side is just 15. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:09:19'>So our brains are processing </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:20'>those simple icons much quicker, </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:22'>and we're seeing that a lot now. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:09:23'>Over the last few years, as design has changed, </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:25'>everybody's going to the simpler icons </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:27'>rather than the more complicated shaded icons </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:32'>that we saw back in the '80s. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:09:36'>So we don't want to create visual stress to users </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:39'>by cluttering the design with too many data points </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:41'>and confusing or unwanted design elements. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:09:45'>So remember we have just 50 milliseconds </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:47'>before users have made </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:48'>their first judgement on our products, </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:50'>so need to make sure it's a good impression from the outset. </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:54'>Like we saw with Bing, </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:55'>we need to constantly test and refine our visual designs, </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:58'>and this is particularly important </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:59'>if you're launching a new product or new feature. </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:03'>So if we look over to Uber now, </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:04'>so Uber spent time learning </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:06'>what customers were doing on their landing page, </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:08'>and they spend a lot of time optimising their landing page </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:11'>to get the most out of it, </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:13'>so they took on a lot of information, </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:15'>and I'll walk through how they actually did this </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:17'>to improve their landing page </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:20'>and improve the user experience </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:22'>all through visual design. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:10:25'>So this is the original landing page. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:10:28'>It's not cluttered. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:10:29'>It has a lot of white space. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:10:31'>It had some nice imagery, </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:32'>but despite the icons being complex, </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:35'>there are actually quite a lot of problems with this design </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:38'>so let's delve a little bit deeper </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:39'>and see what's wrong with them. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:10:41'>So here's the new design, so what's the difference? </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:45'>They actually used real eye heat map, </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:48'>which calculates the quantitative </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:51'>eye movement measurements, </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:54'>and this they're able to look at how long </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:56'>a viewer looks at a particular image, </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:58'>how long they look at it for, </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:00'>where they're going when they're moving around the page, </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:03'>and all of this gives them really important data </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:05'>that they can look at improving, </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:08'>and they could see where users </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:09'>are actually going to their website on their landing page. </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:13'>So if we look at the headline, </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:15'>so the headline is the most important sentence </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:17'>on a landing page. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:11:18'>It tells the user what the page is all about, </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:22'>and if we look a little bit closer at the headline </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:25'>on the heat map, we can see that the old one </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:28'>doesn't really get much attention, </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:30'>but the new one has a huge amount of attention, </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:35'>and this is for a number of reasons. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:11:36'>So the wording is more central on the page. </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:40'>It's got more information. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:11:41'>It tells the user exactly what they need to do next, </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:45'>and they haven't split the sign up button </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:47'>from the registration form. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:11:48'>So this, they can now click straight underneath </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:51'>and go through to sign up, whereas on the old one, </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:53'>they'd actually split those two information, </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:56'>so it was separate, </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:57'>and the most important thing on this </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:00'>is that they've changed the image. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:12:02'>So what impact has change in the image made? </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:06'>So if we look at the old and the new version, </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:09'>you know, and they're okay images, </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:11'>they've still got people in them, </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:12'>so it's still focusing on that region of the brain </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:15'>that processes faces, but the old version, </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:18'>the face is looking straight at you, so as a user, </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:20'>you then look straight back at the face, </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:23'>whereas on the new version, </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:24'>the face is looking over towards the copy, </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:27'>so you're guided by the face over towards the copy. </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:31'>And what they found is that people </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:33'>were looking at that image </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:34'>and then being guided across to the text. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:12:37'>So the text in a much better location, </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:40'>and before it was at the top </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:41'>and it was disjointed from the image, </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:43'>and now it's next to it, </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:45'>and also the text is placed over a white block, </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:48'>so the image is then put in the background, </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:50'>so it becomes less distracting, </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:51'>so you look at the text more, </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:53'>and then the image is then the person's looking at the text </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:56'>so it's guiding your eyes across. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:12:59'>And then if we look at the sign up button, </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:01'>so on the old version, </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:03'>the call to action was much bigger </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:05'>and in a much brighter colour, </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:08'>and so it is very large on the page, </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:11'>but they had a huge amount of call to action buttons, </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:14'>so they had nine call to action buttons </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:16'>on the entire landing page. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:13:17'>Four of them were for just the sign up. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:13:19'>And then on the new version, </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:21'>they've got less wording for the signup button </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:24'>and they've only got four call to action buttons. </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:27'>All of them are for sign up, </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:29'>and the new version got three times more attention </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:33'>for the signup buttons than the old version, </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:35'>and the other thing is, </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:36'>if you notice that the button is actually blue, </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:38'>so they've changed the button, </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:39'>so I don't know if they were listening to, </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:42'>reading what Bing have been up to. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:13:46'>So if we take all of this information </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:49'>that we've looked at, </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:49'>so how does this satisfy our senses? </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:53'>So when we're going through and we're designing things, </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:54'>it's all about having that emotional connection </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:57'>with the product we're working with. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:13:58'>So psychologist Edward Thorndike </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:02'>first coined the term back in the 1920s </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:04'>in a paper called </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:05'>"The Constant Error in Psychological Ratings." </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:08'>So he first coined this halo effect. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:14:11'>There is a phenomenon that social psychologists </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:15'>call the halo effect. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:14:17'>So that means humans tend to assume </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:18'>that good-looking people have other positive qualities </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:21'>aside from their looks. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:14:23'>So that same attitude could also </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:24'>be reflected in our digital products, </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:27'>and there's been a lot of research around this. </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:28'>So people tend to believe that things </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:31'>that look better will work better, </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:33'>even if they aren't actually </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:34'>more attractive or efficient. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:14:36'>So users have a positive emotion response to visual design, </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:41'>and that makes them more tolerant to minor usability issues. </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:44'>In most cases it's a positive thing, </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:47'>as you've already done a lot of the hard work </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:49'>with the visual design, </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:50'>and it gives you that really strong brand </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:52'>and a good digital experience, </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:53'>but it means we need to be really careful in user testing, </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:56'>and when we're testing those rough concepts, </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:58'>we need to make sure we're testing the rough concepts </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:00'>before we go through and do the hi-fi designs, </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:03'>and it prevents you just from judging the visual and design. </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:07'>So ascetically pleasing design satisfies our senses </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:10'>and gives us pleasure, </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:12'>so when we're looking and using aesthetic </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:13'>and pleasing designs, </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:16'>it gives us that reward. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:15:17'>It gives us something back. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:15:19'>So vision is the most dominant sense </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:21'>in the majority of people. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:15:22'>We can't stop ourselves to look at what we find beautiful. </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:27'>It's kind of as if the light is reflecting back </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:29'>and it's a magnet for our eyes </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:31'>and it's drawing us in to the product, and hearing as well, </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:34'>so our ears are capable of perceiving </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:35'>a whole 'nother level of aesthetic design. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:15:38'>An ability to hear how a car engine works, </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:41'>how the digital product notifies you of a new message, </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:44'>all of those things are tapping into our senses, </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:47'>and touch as well. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:15:48'>Touch is the, the skin is the largest organ </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:51'>on the human body. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:15:52'>It helps us experience the aesthetics, </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:54'>so it's essential to those physical products, </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:57'>our phones, the fabric of the chair we're sitting on, </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:59'>all of those things tap into our senses, </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:02'>and aesthetics are in all of our senses, </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:05'>so not just the sight. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:16:07'>As brands expand more and more into AR and VR, </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:10'>we need to tap into those different senses </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:12'>to create great customer experiences. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:16:15'>So some signs are so famous and ingrained in our memory </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:19'>we only have to look at the image </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:20'>and we can already hear the roar of the MGMs lion, </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:24'>but with anything there needs to be a balance. </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:26'>Some sounds are really annoying to users. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:16:29'>So as we saw with Bing and Uber, </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:31'>those first impressions really matter, </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:33'>and the first 10 seconds are all we have </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:35'>to catch a digital customer's attention, </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:37'>so we need to create designs that ascetically pleasing, </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:40'>reduce the visual stress, and tap into the senses </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:42'>to give users pleasures from the start. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:16:45'>It makes them form a bond with the design, </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:48'>and that bond goes beyond the initial interaction. </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:52'>Not long ago, users were expecting </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:53'>only functional and usable products when they were buying, </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:56'>but today user's expectations have evolved </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:59'>together with the design and technology now available, </span> <span data-startTime='00:17:02'>so people expect usability by default </span> <span data-startTime='00:17:04'>and are seeking products </span> <span data-startTime='00:17:05'>that are more than functional and usable. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:17:07'>They want the experience to stimulate their senses </span> <span data-startTime='00:17:10'>and to evoke a positive emotion, </span> <span data-startTime='00:17:12'>so aesthetic design is crucial to satisfy these needs. </span> <span data-startTime='00:17:15'>It's perceived as more friendly, usable, and valuable. </span> <span data-startTime='00:17:18'>Sometimes, however, usability must be on focus </span> <span data-startTime='00:17:23'>rather than the aesthetics, </span> <span data-startTime='00:17:24'>especially when you're dealing with emergency equipment, </span> <span data-startTime='00:17:26'>so you have to design for the audience </span> <span data-startTime='00:17:29'>that you're aiming at. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:17:32'>And it's really annoying when we can't find </span> <span data-startTime='00:17:35'>our way around an app </span> <span data-startTime='00:17:37'>or we don't really understand what the company is offering. </span> <span data-startTime='00:17:40'>It's really frustrating to us as users, </span> <span data-startTime='00:17:42'>and with so many competitors out there, </span> <span data-startTime='00:17:43'>you can easily jump ship and go somewhere else, </span> <span data-startTime='00:17:46'>go and find another brand and use them or delete the app. </span> <span data-startTime='00:17:50'>But other decisions we're making as designers </span> <span data-startTime='00:17:52'>is creating good and bad habits for our users. </span> <span data-startTime='00:17:55'>But so behaviours Nir Eyal wrote </span> <span data-startTime='00:17:58'>the customer engagement manual, </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:00'>"Hooked, How to Build Habit Forming Products." </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:03'>He describes the various triggers designs can use </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:06'>to create more habit forming online environments. </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:11'>So we have this, </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:14'>we've created this continuous psychological itch. </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:18'>So the red circles placed on mobile phone home screens </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:21'>that above our apps that count down, </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:24'>tell us how many outstanding actions we have </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:27'>that still needs to be taken </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:29'>and highlighting unanswered messages. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:18:33'>These kind of all dig into our psyche </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:36'>and they just act this constant reminder </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:39'>that we need to close that digital loop. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:18:43'>We need to go through and we need to close those off, </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:45'>and this can really tap into the minds of users </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:48'>who really like to have those zero inboxes, </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:50'>so my husband's one of those people, </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:53'>likes to have it all clean and empty. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:18:55'>Doesn't understand why I have messages </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:57'>that I haven't replied to (laughs). </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:18:59'>So it all taps into different people's psyche </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:02'>slightly differently, but it's just closing </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:04'>that digital loop. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:19:05'>That's what we're trying to do with this. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:19:08'>And social network insights seek to embed themselves </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:11'>at the centre of the user's emotional life. </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:14'>So he suggests and I'll suggest that Instagram exploits </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:18'>the quiet anxiety that occurs </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:20'>when users fear a special moment will be lost forever. </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:23'>So having that FOMO. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:19:25'>So this need to document and preserve is supported </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:31'>with the app's ability for different filters, </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:33'>visual icons that make the poorest quality </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:36'>much more attractive. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:19:37'>So we're creating a really sad and false world, really, </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:40'>with a lot of these digital products. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:19:43'>And another thing that he suggests is </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:44'>that you users who find a product that alleviates their pain </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:47'>will form strong positive associations </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:50'>with that product over time, </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:52'>And these bonds cement into the habit </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:54'>as they turn to the product </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:55'>when experiencing certain internal triggers. </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:59'>He does, however advocate for the infinite scroll, </span> <span data-startTime='00:20:03'>and he sees it as design's answer </span> <span data-startTime='00:20:05'>to our constant and endless search for novelty. </span> <span data-startTime='00:20:09'>So the endlessly refresh content </span> <span data-startTime='00:20:11'>activates dopamine in our systems, </span> <span data-startTime='00:20:13'>so not to provide us with rewards for our efforts, </span> <span data-startTime='00:20:16'>but to keep us searching </span> <span data-startTime='00:20:18'>by inducing semi stressful responses we call desire. </span> <span data-startTime='00:20:24'>And Gerald Moore also has done a lot of work </span> <span data-startTime='00:20:29'>around, the dopamine levels as well. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:20:31'>So he says that mining dopamine in the human brain </span> <span data-startTime='00:20:34'>is a core technique for driving digital consumption. </span> <span data-startTime='00:20:37'>So he suggests that repetitive behaviours, </span> <span data-startTime='00:20:40'>it stimulates more dopamine hits, </span> <span data-startTime='00:20:42'>such as scrolling, liking a posting, </span> <span data-startTime='00:20:44'>produces changes in the neural pathways to the brain </span> <span data-startTime='00:20:48'>that narrow attention reduce the variety </span> <span data-startTime='00:20:50'>to stimuli that feel good. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:20:52'>So he believes that more attention needs to be devoted </span> <span data-startTime='00:20:55'>to understanding the experiential </span> <span data-startTime='00:20:57'>and cultural implications of living in a digital society </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:01'>where design mechanisms constantly work </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:03'>to stimulate our brain to distract, lure, and entice us. </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:08'>So we need to be careful as designers </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:10'>that we're creating the right feel for our products. </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:16'>But the psychological pleasure can also come </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:18'>from completing a task, feeling in control, and safe. </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:21'>This can be very tightly related </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:23'>to the usability of the product, </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:25'>but also how the product looks, </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:27'>so a solid and stable looking car </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:28'>gives more psychological comfort </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:30'>than one that seems like it might break </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:32'>if you open the door. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:21:33'>The same is true for digital products </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:35'>where the user feels in control and knows the task </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:38'>can be completed and their actions are saved, </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:41'>and using aesthetics plays a big role </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:43'>in making the users feel safe and in control </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:46'>making it look and feel simple and stable </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:48'>and guiding the user. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:21:50'>So we can also trigger psychological pleasure </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:53'>by taking sustainability at the sustainability angle. </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:57'>It can make the user feel good </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:58'>because they have contributed in some way </span> <span data-startTime='00:22:01'>to a cause that they're passionate about. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:22:05'>So if we look at the Girlfriend Collective, </span> <span data-startTime='00:22:10'>they create leggings out of plastic, </span> <span data-startTime='00:22:12'>and the way they do this is it's tapping into, you know, </span> <span data-startTime='00:22:17'>we've got a huge plastic problem globally, </span> <span data-startTime='00:22:20'>and so they're tapping into that side of things </span> <span data-startTime='00:22:23'>of how they can use plastic for the better, </span> <span data-startTime='00:22:25'>and to create something that people will wear, </span> <span data-startTime='00:22:28'>but also it's good for the environment, </span> <span data-startTime='00:22:31'>and also they go through the entire life cycle as well, </span> <span data-startTime='00:22:34'>so their whole product is very, very open and transparent, </span> <span data-startTime='00:22:39'>so they focus on this in complete life cycle </span> <span data-startTime='00:22:41'>of the product from production through to disposal, </span> <span data-startTime='00:22:45'>and they've managed to divert 6 million </span> <span data-startTime='00:22:48'>post-consumer plastic water bottles </span> <span data-startTime='00:22:50'>from the landfill sites since its creation. </span> <span data-startTime='00:22:53'>And the employees are from Vietnam </span> <span data-startTime='00:22:55'>and they're paid above minimum wage </span> <span data-startTime='00:22:57'>starting at 125% above the wage in the country, </span> <span data-startTime='00:23:01'>and they provide breakfast, food, </span> <span data-startTime='00:23:03'>lunch, coffee, health checkups, </span> <span data-startTime='00:23:06'>everything for their employees, </span> <span data-startTime='00:23:08'>as they're really looking after their employees, </span> <span data-startTime='00:23:10'>but they're tapping into that psychological pleasure, </span> <span data-startTime='00:23:13'>that as a user, you feel like you're helping solve a problem </span> <span data-startTime='00:23:17'>by buying their product, and this is where design comes in, </span> <span data-startTime='00:23:20'>so making sure that that information </span> <span data-startTime='00:23:22'>is communicated properly through their website </span> <span data-startTime='00:23:25'>and through all their digital communications. </span> <span data-startTime='00:23:28'>So let's look at how brands are actually combining </span> <span data-startTime='00:23:30'>the UI and their branding together </span> <span data-startTime='00:23:33'>to extend their brand beyond a surface level identity </span> <span data-startTime='00:23:37'>and to actually solve customer problems. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:23:41'>So we'll look at HotelTonight. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:23:43'>HotelTonight managed to increase their revenue </span> <span data-startTime='00:23:47'>by more than 10% a year. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:23:49'>So how did they do that? </span> <span data-startTime='00:23:52'>So HotelTonight is an app that helps users </span> <span data-startTime='00:23:54'>find last minute details on hotel rooms, </span> <span data-startTime='00:23:58'>so they focused on creating a really simple UI </span> <span data-startTime='00:24:01'>where users could find and book a room and just three taps. </span> <span data-startTime='00:24:04'>The problem was they'd made it too easy. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:24:06'>When they launched in 2011, </span> <span data-startTime='00:24:08'>two in every thousand customers were booking accidentally, </span> <span data-startTime='00:24:12'>and the bookings are also generally non-refundable, </span> <span data-startTime='00:24:14'>so luckily for the customers, the CEO, Sam Shark, </span> <span data-startTime='00:24:18'>decided to issue refunds, </span> <span data-startTime='00:24:19'>but this cut into the company's profits by 4%, </span> <span data-startTime='00:24:22'>which is a huge amount of money for a young startup. </span> <span data-startTime='00:24:28'>So what did they do? </span> <span data-startTime='00:24:29'>This simple UI had become too simple, </span> <span data-startTime='00:24:32'>so they began to look at different solutions, </span> <span data-startTime='00:24:34'>and first they asked users to plug in their initials </span> <span data-startTime='00:24:38'>before the final confirmation, but they felt, </span> <span data-startTime='00:24:41'>and they saw some results from this, </span> <span data-startTime='00:24:43'>but they felt that it was a little bit clunky </span> <span data-startTime='00:24:45'>and it felt a bit too corporate for their brand, </span> <span data-startTime='00:24:48'>and so the engineer at the time, so Ray Lily White, </span> <span data-startTime='00:24:51'>he came up with the UI solution </span> <span data-startTime='00:24:52'>that's still in practise five years later. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:24:55'>So to book a room the users must trace </span> <span data-startTime='00:24:57'>the company H bed logo with their finger </span> <span data-startTime='00:25:00'>as confirmation before the room is booked. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:25:03'>So adding an anti-pattern in actually slowed users down </span> <span data-startTime='00:25:06'>to think before they actually booked something, </span> <span data-startTime='00:25:09'>so rather than doing the tap, tap, tap </span> <span data-startTime='00:25:11'>that we've all learned to do very, </span> <span data-startTime='00:25:12'>very quickly with our devices, </span> <span data-startTime='00:25:17'>they actually had to reverse that </span> <span data-startTime='00:25:18'>and actually slow the user down. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:25:20'>So the logo has become more than just a brand's icon. </span> <span data-startTime='00:25:23'>It's now a clever UI feature. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:25:25'>There's a direct impact on the company's profits. </span> <span data-startTime='00:25:30'>So accidentally booking rooms dropped </span> <span data-startTime='00:25:34'>and the retention increased </span> <span data-startTime='00:25:35'>and non-completion of the booking process dropped by 75%. </span> <span data-startTime='00:25:41'>So huge return for the company, </span> <span data-startTime='00:25:44'>just from changing the UI </span> <span data-startTime='00:25:46'>and bringing in their logo into the design. </span> <span data-startTime='00:25:49'>So Sam says it's become an iconic feature </span> <span data-startTime='00:25:52'>of HotelTonight now, </span> <span data-startTime='00:25:53'>so they now say three taps and a swipe to book a hotel. </span> <span data-startTime='00:25:59'>So the pretty design can make users more forgiving </span> <span data-startTime='00:26:02'>of minor usability problems, but not of large ones. </span> <span data-startTime='00:26:05'>If the user can't find the product, </span> <span data-startTime='00:26:06'>the user can't buy the product, </span> <span data-startTime='00:26:08'>and even great looking sites will have no revenue </span> <span data-startTime='00:26:10'>if they suffer from poor findability </span> <span data-startTime='00:26:13'>or the UI is too simple, </span> <span data-startTime='00:26:15'>or the company's had to make huge refunds. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:26:21'>So form and function need to work together, </span> <span data-startTime='00:26:23'>and designing an interface that's attractive </span> <span data-startTime='00:26:26'>as well as functional is worth resources, </span> <span data-startTime='00:26:29'>because at the end of the day, </span> <span data-startTime='00:26:30'>first impressions matter. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:26:32'>Aesthetic design influences how people think and feel. </span> <span data-startTime='00:26:35'>It taps into the senses. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:26:37'>It influences how much pleasure we feel from the product. </span> <span data-startTime='00:26:40'>It reduces the processing load of our brains </span> <span data-startTime='00:26:42'>and reduces visual stress, </span> <span data-startTime='00:26:44'>making users more brand-loyal </span> <span data-startTime='00:26:46'>and tolerant towards mistakes or failures. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:26:49'>And imagine all the Apple fans out there, </span> <span data-startTime='00:26:51'>especially now with the new interface upgrade, </span> <span data-startTime='00:26:53'>which I'm finding really annoying, </span> <span data-startTime='00:26:56'>especially when I'm trying to put some reminders in my phone </span> <span data-startTime='00:27:01'>or change my alarm and things like that. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:27:03'>It's really annoying, </span> <span data-startTime='00:27:06'>and it's not just important for the first impressions. </span> <span data-startTime='00:27:08'>It affects our longterm attitude </span> <span data-startTime='00:27:10'>towards a product or brand, </span> <span data-startTime='00:27:12'>and it keeps strengthening the bond with the user over time. </span> <span data-startTime='00:27:17'>Thank you. </span> </p>

		<p><span data-startTime='00:00:00'>(upbeat music) </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:11'>- Hi, my name is Ashley Hefnawy </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:14'>and I am going to talk to you a little bit about UX, </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:19'>specifically through the lens of writing </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:24'>and how I have re-imagined it as the human experience </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:29'>rather than user experience. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:00:32'>So, the name of this talk is UX = The Human Experience, </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:37'>How UX Can Help Humanise Products in the Age of COVID-19 </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:42'>and Beyond, ideally. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:00:45'>This is a little run of show, what we'll be covering. </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:48'>I'm gonna give you a little bit of an intro on who I am, </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:51'>why I'm here, why you are listening to me talk about this, </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:57'>we'll talk a little bit about what UX writing is, </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:01'>since many people don't seem to know, </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:05'>though, I imagine that most people watching this </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:09'>have a solid grasp of what it is, </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:12'>we're going to compare UX user experience </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:16'>and what I've coined as a term </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:20'>that applies to the way I practise my skills </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:24'>and write with my clients, human experience, </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:29'>we'll talk a little bit about the Umami Theory </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:32'>and we'll end with the reckoning of 2020 </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:38'>and cover a little bit about what I think </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:43'>products need to do beyond branding </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:45'>and beyond relying on communications and language </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:49'>to basically relay what it is that they, </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:56'>what it is, the purpose that they serve. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:01:59'>So, a little bit about me, </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:02'>I am a creative person, </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:06'>I'm a writer, I'm an interdisciplinary artist, </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:10'>community events organiser, cat owner, </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:16'>she's actually sleeping on a chair right next to me </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:19'>and I'm hoping that she doesn't decide to wake up </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:22'>and walk over my camera, but I think she's in her sleep </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:26'>for the next 24 hours and won't. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:02:31'>I have been writing for about a decade now, professionally. </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:37'>I've worked with a number of clients and companies, </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:41'>large and small, in basically any capacity </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:45'>you could think of when it comes to communications. </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:49'>So, I've worked as a copywriter for marketing web product </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:55'>and in the last couple of years, </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:58'>I have pivoted to UX writing </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:02'>and I found it to be quite fascinating, </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:07'>strange, interesting, meta </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:11'>and I've also found that as a UX writer, </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:15'>I'm often hired to help companies and brands </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:19'>humanise their voice and help them ensure that </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:24'>different aspects that make up their product experience </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:27'>are clear and easy to follow </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:31'>without making anybody feel left behind. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:03:34'>So, what the heck is UX writing? </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:39'>A lot of people I talk to about UX writing </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:42'>have no idea what it is, especially when you're talking </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:45'>to people outside of the tech space. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:03:49'>I find it kind of funny because I think </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:53'>it's embedded in absolutely everything we do </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:57'>and ultimately, I think that UX writing </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:01'>as a name is what throws people off. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:04:04'>But when you actually explain what it is, </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:08'>the purpose that it serves, people tend to understand. </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:14'>So, a couple of points that I have turned to </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:20'>for explaining what UX writing is, </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:24'>is that, it's the communications that help us get </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:27'>from point A to point B. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:04:30'>I think of it as extremely meta. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:04:32'>It's like, we're talking about the box within the box </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:36'>and oftentimes when experiencing UX and UX writing, </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:44'>the people who are experiencing it </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:46'>are not necessarily cognizant of what it is </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:48'>that they're engaging with. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:04:51'>So, why is that? </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:52'>Is it because they have a bit of a brand association </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:56'>already and so, the minutia, maybe the UX writing </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:00'>falls under that, kind of gets swept under the rug. </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:04'>But on the other hand, I really do think of it as the vibe. </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:08'>It's like the atmosphere we feel </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:10'>when we're inside a product experience </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:14'>and if it's bad, it can really make us feel dumb </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:19'>or it can make us feel frustrated, </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:21'>it can make us feel like we don't get technology. </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:25'>This is an experience that I have regularly </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:29'>with different products and different apps </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:32'>and I imagine many people have this experience as well. </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:38'>So, I always try to explain it in the most simple way </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:41'>possible, which is why I turned to these points </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:45'>and I've done this so many times that I've started to wonder </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:49'>if I should just reframe the way I talk about it </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:53'>and talk about users instead, speaking to the humans </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:58'>and the people that are actually using the products </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:02'>rather than generalising them with this term that people </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:06'>don't really understand unless they work in that space. </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:11'>So, the reason we're talking about it today </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:14'>is a number of things. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:06:17'>I, like many people during this strange </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:21'>and bizarre year, have really evaluated the work </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:26'>that I've been doing and evaluated the landscape </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:31'>in which UX writing and my writing </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:34'>exists within this COVID-19 era. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:06:38'>I have noticed that humanity and the people around me, </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:42'>especially have turned to products and systems </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:46'>for help in times of distress, more than ever. </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:51'>I think that good products that help humanity </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:54'>require UX that does not get in the way </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:59'>and that's kind of like what I was explaining before. </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:02'>If you're in a product experience that is really positive, </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:05'>you're probably not really thinking about the UX that much </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:08'>and that's kind of why I think of it as very meta. </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:12'>I think that good UX writing relies on a product </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:15'>that cares about its people. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:07:17'>You can't have good UX if the product </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:20'>doesn't care about its users and that really is like, </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:23'>I think the foundation of it all. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:07:26'>Like, you can't necessarily use UX writing </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:31'>as a way to cover up a product that doesn't care </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:36'>or a product that actually has no purpose. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:07:42'>So, we're framing UX writing in COVID-19, this year of 2020 </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:49'>and I'm personally thinking about the future </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:53'>and what UX writing and what my work will look like </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:56'>and how it will evolve and perhaps how things will change. </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:01'>So, I think personally, </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:04'>I think there's no returning back to normal, </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:06'>I think that everything is different </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:09'>and going to continue to evolve as this pandemic continues. </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:14'>I think I've seen so many things </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:17'>get the magnifying glass treatment. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:08:20'>I have noticed how cancel culture lacks depth </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:23'>and that is honestly a topic for an entirely different </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:26'>presentation because I could speak on that forever </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:31'>and I think accountability is really where it's at. </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:34'>I think that we are trying to hold ourselves accountable, </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:38'>we're trying to hold our communities accountable </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:41'>and we're trying to, as much as we can, </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:45'>hold the products we engage with accountable. </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:49'>So, how does this affect UX writing and products? </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:53'>This is where I introduce a concept </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:55'>that is maybe not totally groundbreaking, </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:59'>but something that really, </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:03'>something that dictates the way that I work. </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:07'>So, I've reframed user experience as human experience </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:13'>and I've done this for a couple of reasons. </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:15'>One, part of my job often when working with clients </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:21'>is to name things, come up with new names during a rebrand </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:28'>and if I had been involved in the naming of user experience, </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:32'>I probably would have renamed it to human experience. </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:36'>Like I said, not totally groundbreaking, </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:40'>what's the difference between human and user, </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:43'>but I think there's actually a lot of differences </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:47'>between the two. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:09:48'>I think that human feels more natural, </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:52'>I think that user feels extremely generic </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:55'>and we can go ahead and break that down </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:58'>in the following slide. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:10:00'>So here we have a comparison between UX and HX. </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:06'>For the purposes of these lists, </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:08'>I am just thinking about user versus human. </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:11'>The key differences between UX and HX </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:15'>are that HX doesn't really feel like jargon to me. </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:19'>Maybe if you think about it in terms of the abbreviations, </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:23'>sure, but once somebody understands that </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:26'>HX stands for human experience, it feels like a term </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:31'>that is actually meant to be public facing. </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:34'>The human experience feels philosophical, </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:37'>it feels less enigmatic and it peaks curiosity. </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:42'>Human experience not only leaves room for natural curiosity </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:47'>and opens doors to conversations </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:50'>about the actual work that I do, </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:52'>but it also kind of allows me to talk about </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:56'>how writing within product spaces helps humans. </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:01'>It helps me talk about how I assess values </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:05'>with all the clients I work with, </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:07'>the value of the work that I'm providing </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:09'>and the value of the service or product </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:13'>that is being created </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:16'>and this really comes down to a much bigger picture way </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:22'>that I work personally, which is values first. </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:26'>I always have a value assessment </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:30'>when it comes to taking on new projects. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:11:32'>Does this product match with my own values? </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:37'>Do I see the value that I'm bringing to this product </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:40'>as something that is needed or worthwhile? </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:45'>And I think that ultimately plays into </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:50'>why I think of user experience as human experience. </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:55'>I don't see products as these little siloed worlds </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:00'>that are created for, you know, ideal users, </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:07'>I think they exist within a landscape and a narrative </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:11'>that is real and so often I think we encounter products </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:18'>that are slow to evolve with the reality of the world </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:22'>that they exist in. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:12:24'>So, to compare all of this to user experience, </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:29'>this feels like a child of the tech space, user experience, </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:36'>which is totally fine, but I think in 2020, </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:39'>if we're giving everything a reevaluation </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:44'>and the nature of my work is evolving, </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:47'>I can't help but feel as though the word </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:53'>that I use to describe the work that I do </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:56'>deserves a reevaluation as well. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:13:01'>When it comes down to it, </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:02'>I strive to write human experience copy, </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:06'>copy that is cognizant of the world </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:10'>and the environment in which it is situated. </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:15'>So, let's look at a couple of examples, </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:17'>so that you can actually start to wrap your head around </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:20'>what I'm talking about. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:13:22'>I think that looking at products and services that exist </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:27'>within this 2020 landscape is a really perfect way </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:30'>to bring to life the concept that I'm talking about. </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:34'>So we have Airbnb, </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:38'>it's a well-known service that provides </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:43'>hotel like accommodations on a very local scale </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:47'>where people offer up their homes </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:50'>to people who are travelling. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:13:52'>So, throughout the experience on Airbnb, </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:57'>you are reminded that travelling is not necessarily </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:01'>something we can all afford right now, </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:03'>but something that we all still deserve </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:07'>and that there are ways to do so safely. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:14:10'>It is not lost on me in the experience of the Airbnb app </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:16'>that we are living in the middle of a pandemic </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:20'>and that is made clear through lots of messaging </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:26'>that is not alarmist, but real and human, </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:31'>letting us know that hosts are taking extra safety </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:38'>and cleaning measures to make sure that </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:40'>they are creating sanitary spaces for the people </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:44'>who are coming to visit, </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:47'>all of the protocols are regularly updated </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:50'>and very clear at the front and centre of every page </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:54'>that you navigate to </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:57'>and I think it's just a great way to see how a service </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:02'>has adapted to a time that is unprecedented. </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:07'>I think ultimately, Airbnb had no choice but to do this, </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:11'>but if they didn't, they would shut down </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:16'>and lose business in the longterm </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:22'>and I think that if they don't acknowledge </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:25'>the reality of our times, </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:26'>they risk not only losing business in the short term, </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:30'>but damaging their reputation in the longterm. </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:35'>So, here's another example of a hospitality service </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:39'>and there's a reason I chose hospitality. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:15:41'>I think it is the most simple example </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:46'>of human experience communication right now </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:49'>because they are dealing with humans </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:52'>who are trying to have an experience other than the reality, </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:57'>perhaps that they are living in, </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:59'>staying locked indoors in their homes. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:16:02'>As we've learned this year, there are safe ways to travel </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:07'>and it is, I think, the responsibility of the people </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:11'>who create services to help accommodate travellers, </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:16'>to let them know that they are safe </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:19'>and that these options are viable. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:16:23'>So, another example that I'd like to talk about </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:27'>is this app called One Night. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:16:29'>It offers people the chance to book hotel rooms </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:34'>at extremely discounted rates one to two days in advance. </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:39'>I think the concept is great </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:42'>and I'm personally probably going to test it out, </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:45'>but I did notice one area that they really missed out on </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:51'>from a communications and human perspective, </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:54'>which is this 24 hour guide that they have </span> <span data-startTime='00:17:00'>pretty centrally located in the app. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:17:04'>Basically, you'll see a list of hotels that come up </span> <span data-startTime='00:17:07'>with different rates based on the dates that you select </span> <span data-startTime='00:17:10'>and once you navigate to the hotel page </span> <span data-startTime='00:17:15'>and below the booking CTA option is a 24 hour guide </span> <span data-startTime='00:17:22'>and it is in theory supposed to give people tips </span> <span data-startTime='00:17:27'>on what they can do around the hotel </span> <span data-startTime='00:17:30'>for the duration of their stay. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:17:32'>I think this is a fantastic idea, </span> <span data-startTime='00:17:35'>embedding a sort of local guide into the app. </span> <span data-startTime='00:17:40'>However, I've noticed that the tips don't take anything </span> <span data-startTime='00:17:44'>into consideration about the reality </span> <span data-startTime='00:17:47'>of what it is that travellers are living through right now. </span> <span data-startTime='00:17:52'>If people are coming to New York, </span> <span data-startTime='00:17:53'>they're going to have a really different experience </span> <span data-startTime='00:17:56'>in this moment than they would otherwise. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:18:00'>Perhaps the restaurants that they want to go to </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:03'>are no longer open for business </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:07'>or if they are, they might have a really different </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:09'>environment for how people can come </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:12'>to experience their restaurant. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:18:15'>Music venues are not open, people aren't going out dancing. </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:21'>You know, bars, many of them have outside seating now, </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:26'>but they also have to serve food, </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:28'>so that kind of makes a lot of bars </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:31'>off the table in terms of business. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:18:35'>So, these are all things that I saw in the 24 hour guides </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:40'>and I was shocked because I felt like </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:47'>it totally disregarded the moment that we're living in </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:50'>and was a missed opportunity to show people, </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:54'>hey, we care about you, here's some tips </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:56'>that actually might be viable for you during your stay. </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:59'>We know that you need a break, </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:02'>we know that you're coming to this hotel, </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:04'>this hotel is still open and functioning, </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:06'>but things are a little bit different </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:08'>and here are some fun safe ways for you </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:11'>to engage with your surroundings </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:13'>while still pressing messaging that is both human </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:19'>and also care centred, letting people know that </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:23'>you care about their safety and wellbeing. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:19:26'>I understand that all of this is grim, </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:29'>but I think it's the reality </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:31'>and I think in order for products to continue to evolve </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:36'>and to grow in a time after this pandemic, </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:42'>they need to consider the things that we are learning </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:45'>about ourselves, about society, about humanity, </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:49'>about how we engage with each other, </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:51'>about how we engage with brands and products </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:54'>that we come to trust and work less in a reactive state </span> <span data-startTime='00:20:03'>and more in a planning and responsive state. </span> <span data-startTime='00:20:08'>So, the Umami Theory, for the record, </span> <span data-startTime='00:20:11'>the title of this slide and the quote credit </span> <span data-startTime='00:20:13'>both link to the full memo that was written by Nemesis, </span> <span data-startTime='00:20:18'>which is a consulting duo composed </span> <span data-startTime='00:20:22'>of Emily Segal and Martti Kalliala. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:20:26'>The essence of their memo is that </span> <span data-startTime='00:20:28'>we've been coasting on this experience economy, </span> <span data-startTime='00:20:32'>which ultimately lacks depth </span> <span data-startTime='00:20:35'>and has more to do with surface desire than actual desire. </span> <span data-startTime='00:20:40'>It's part of the reason why apps like Instagram, </span> <span data-startTime='00:20:43'>Twitter, Facebook are so successful. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:20:46'>They sell and promise you one thing, </span> <span data-startTime='00:20:48'>which is that you control your online persona, your brand, </span> <span data-startTime='00:20:53'>you control how you are perceived, </span> <span data-startTime='00:20:56'>which quite frankly, I think is impossible, </span> <span data-startTime='00:20:59'>when in reality, they're actually selling you, </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:01'>the user or the human. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:21:05'>I bring this up because surface desire and the lack of depth </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:09'>feels connected to the way I feel </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:12'>when I talk about the bad user experience. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:21:16'>Like, how could I not be thinking about the user </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:20'>the whole time while creating a product, </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:23'>it really baffles me, but the vision needs to be consistent, </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:27'>you can't just hire me to fix a problem </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:31'>and make your product sound more human </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:34'>if it wasn't created for a human experience to begin with. </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:39'>So one of the quotes says, </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:42'>"We believe that umami has been both literally </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:45'>and figuratively the key commodity </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:48'>of the experience economy. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:21:50'>Umami as both a quality and effect of an experience </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:55'>popped up primarily in settings that were on the verge </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:58'>of disintegration and hinged on physical pilgrimages </span> <span data-startTime='00:22:02'>to evanescent meccas. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:22:05'>We also believe that the experience economy is dying. </span> <span data-startTime='00:22:09'>Its key commodity, umami, has changed status </span> <span data-startTime='00:22:12'>and nobody knows what's coming next." </span> <span data-startTime='00:22:16'>I bring all of that up to ground us back in 2020 </span> <span data-startTime='00:22:20'>and to allow us to sit and meditate </span> <span data-startTime='00:22:24'>with what it is that this year is forcing us to reckon with. </span> <span data-startTime='00:22:29'>2020 has shown us how broken and fragile </span> <span data-startTime='00:22:33'>our existing systems are, </span> <span data-startTime='00:22:35'>which absolutely applies to the products we rely on </span> <span data-startTime='00:22:39'>and the ways in which we engage with each other. </span> <span data-startTime='00:22:44'>Our society, our products, our brands that we know and love </span> <span data-startTime='00:22:47'>are all being put through </span> <span data-startTime='00:22:49'>what I like to think of as therapy. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:22:52'>The ones that are ready and willing to receive help </span> <span data-startTime='00:22:55'>are willing to change and the ones that are ready </span> <span data-startTime='00:22:59'>for the truth are also willing to change. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:23:03'>But the ones that are founded on lies may not survive. </span> <span data-startTime='00:23:08'>The truth is that we can't keep pretending </span> <span data-startTime='00:23:11'>that products are used by humans in an ideal state. </span> <span data-startTime='00:23:15'>Most of us who use an iPhone right now, for example, </span> <span data-startTime='00:23:19'>are not living in an ideal world </span> <span data-startTime='00:23:22'>and I think the iPhone has generally adapted its systems </span> <span data-startTime='00:23:28'>and the ways that it engages with humans to try and help us. </span> <span data-startTime='00:23:33'>But ultimately, if we want to continue to create products </span> <span data-startTime='00:23:36'>for people who are living in reality, </span> <span data-startTime='00:23:39'>we have to acknowledge that our products are embedded </span> <span data-startTime='00:23:42'>into the human experience </span> <span data-startTime='00:23:45'>and that the writing that helps get us </span> <span data-startTime='00:23:47'>from point A to point B within a product </span> <span data-startTime='00:23:50'>needs to acknowledge that. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:23:52'>It's not possible or sustainable anymore </span> <span data-startTime='00:23:55'>to talk to people as if they're robots </span> <span data-startTime='00:23:58'>or treat them like they're children. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:24:01'>So, as we continue to move forward in this world </span> <span data-startTime='00:24:06'>beyond COVID-19 era, we have to imagine a time </span> <span data-startTime='00:24:10'>that is not now and even though it might be hard </span> <span data-startTime='00:24:13'>to envision, we have to imagine that we will see shifts, </span> <span data-startTime='00:24:16'>not only in the ways that we understand </span> <span data-startTime='00:24:19'>what humanization means for ourselves </span> <span data-startTime='00:24:23'>and how we relate to other people, perhaps if we're lucky, </span> <span data-startTime='00:24:26'>the presence of masks will be more widespread </span> <span data-startTime='00:24:29'>in an effort to show others that we care about their health </span> <span data-startTime='00:24:32'>just as much as we care about our own, </span> <span data-startTime='00:24:36'>or perhaps we'll see the evolution past a handshake greeting </span> <span data-startTime='00:24:42'>and how we relate to products. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:24:44'>I imagine as we move forward in this world of work </span> <span data-startTime='00:24:48'>post COVID-19, we will see shifts, not only in the ways </span> <span data-startTime='00:24:53'>that we understand what humanization means for ourselves </span> <span data-startTime='00:24:56'>and how we relate to one another, </span> <span data-startTime='00:24:58'>but how we relate to products. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:25:00'>I'm hoping that maybe masks become more widespread. </span> <span data-startTime='00:25:05'>I think that this is a moment in our humanity where we are, </span> <span data-startTime='00:25:09'>at least I can speak for myself in New York City, </span> <span data-startTime='00:25:14'>dealing with systems of care </span> <span data-startTime='00:25:20'>on a level that maybe we're not used to. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:25:23'>So, wearing a mask for not yourself, </span> <span data-startTime='00:25:25'>but for other people is a system of care. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:25:30'>I don't think people are used to that necessarily </span> <span data-startTime='00:25:33'>because we live in a society that is so focused </span> <span data-startTime='00:25:36'>on the individual. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:25:37'>I am imagining a world in which products that </span> <span data-startTime='00:25:40'>make their ways into our lives </span> <span data-startTime='00:25:42'>are actually given substantial thought, </span> <span data-startTime='00:25:45'>not because of empty brand associations </span> <span data-startTime='00:25:48'>and as a brand strategist, I can also say that it is wild </span> <span data-startTime='00:25:54'>what you can sell if it just looks pretty, </span> <span data-startTime='00:25:57'>but because I think the products need to actually work. </span> <span data-startTime='00:26:02'>The products can't complete us, </span> <span data-startTime='00:26:05'>rather, they help us be better humans to ourselves </span> <span data-startTime='00:26:09'>and to each other. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:26:11'>So, when I say products that are beyond branding, </span> <span data-startTime='00:26:14'>I'm thinking of products that are mindful </span> <span data-startTime='00:26:17'>of the human experience, </span> <span data-startTime='00:26:19'>that challenge capitalist desires for wealth and power </span> <span data-startTime='00:26:22'>and oftentimes, what we attribute to success. </span> <span data-startTime='00:26:26'>I'm thinking of products that centre the human </span> <span data-startTime='00:26:30'>and their relationship to the product. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:26:32'>I'm thinking of products that don't rely </span> <span data-startTime='00:26:36'>on brand associations </span> <span data-startTime='00:26:38'>and honestly, I'm thinking of products </span> <span data-startTime='00:26:41'>that don't want us to be codependent. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:26:44'>That's not how healthy relationships work in real life </span> <span data-startTime='00:26:47'>from human to human and that isn't how I imagine us </span> <span data-startTime='00:26:52'>evolving with technology in mind. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:26:54'>At the end of the day, I think that our products </span> <span data-startTime='00:26:57'>need to help us be better humans to ourselves </span> <span data-startTime='00:27:00'>and be better to each other </span> <span data-startTime='00:27:02'>and that doesn't mean that you need to start </span> <span data-startTime='00:27:04'>creating products that are wellness or health inspired, </span> <span data-startTime='00:27:10'>I'm saying that that can happen </span> <span data-startTime='00:27:13'>within any context for any product. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:27:17'>So in conclusion, what have we covered, </span> <span data-startTime='00:27:21'>what have we talked about, what is this all about? </span> <span data-startTime='00:27:25'>When I'm thinking of user experience writing </span> <span data-startTime='00:27:29'>and human experience writing in the future, </span> <span data-startTime='00:27:32'>I'm thinking of human experience as one </span> <span data-startTime='00:27:37'>that acknowledges the human using the given product </span> <span data-startTime='00:27:40'>and stops talking about them as some user. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:27:43'>They're not a dog, they're not an animal, </span> <span data-startTime='00:27:46'>they're not, you know, an inanimate object. </span> <span data-startTime='00:27:50'>They are human and they have real emotions </span> <span data-startTime='00:27:54'>and require empathy and compassion </span> <span data-startTime='00:27:57'>and that is all language that is sprinkled </span> <span data-startTime='00:28:01'>into UX principles and how we teach people </span> <span data-startTime='00:28:06'>to work in UX spaces, but I think it needs to be levelled up. </span> <span data-startTime='00:28:10'>It needs to acknowledge that this societal narrative </span> <span data-startTime='00:28:14'>that a product is part of is extremely important, </span> <span data-startTime='00:28:18'>that the product doesn't exist in a bubble, </span> <span data-startTime='00:28:20'>but that iPhones are used by people of all walks of life, </span> <span data-startTime='00:28:26'>that products are used by people of all walks of life </span> <span data-startTime='00:28:32'>and I think, especially for me as a writer, </span> <span data-startTime='00:28:37'>I'm going to be thinking about the intention </span> <span data-startTime='00:28:40'>behind communication and what that communication serves, </span> <span data-startTime='00:28:46'>how it can help somebody, </span> <span data-startTime='00:28:48'>not just get from point A to point B, but you know, </span> <span data-startTime='00:28:53'>really have an experience that is meaningful </span> <span data-startTime='00:28:56'>and impactful and less passive. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:28:59'>So, that's all I have for you today, I hope that made sense. </span> <span data-startTime='00:29:04'>I really enjoyed giving this talk. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:29:06'>This is a topic that is very near and dear to my heart </span> <span data-startTime='00:29:10'>and that matters a lot about the work that I do. </span> <span data-startTime='00:29:13'>Thank you for tuning in </span> <span data-startTime='00:29:15'>and I hope you have a wonderful rest of your day </span> <span data-startTime='00:29:19'>and that this talk helped you learn a little bit </span> <span data-startTime='00:29:23'>about products and about writing </span> <span data-startTime='00:29:27'>and about meaningful communication. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:29:29'>Thank you. </span> </p>

		<p><span data-startTime='00:00:00'>(gentle music) </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:10'>- Thanks for the opportunity to speak </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:11'>to you today about machine learning for product managers. </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:14'>The idea of the talk came because Matt and I </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:17'>have very different perspectives on machine learning. </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:20'>Matt comes from a very technical background, </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:23'>whereas my background is a long time in product. </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:26'>And what we found is that machine learning discussion </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:31'>that's out there comes from those two perspectives, </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:35'>but there's not much in the middle. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:00:37'>So there's very deep technical talks about machine learning, </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:40'>and then there's often very high-level strategic talks </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:44'>about how machine learning is going to change everything. </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:46'>What we wanted to do was a talk that looks at the overlap </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:50'>about what can we actually do today </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:53'>with machine learning with our current products. </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:57'>So what we're going to cover is first of all </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:00'>start with a definition and then we're going to take you </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:02'>through the classic product management lenses </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:07'>and look at machine learning from that perspective. </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:10'>So let's get started </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:11'>and I'll hand over to Matt to kick us off. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:01:16'>Okay, so, you know, what is machine learning? </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:19'>This is a conversation I have with a lot of different people </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:21'>because there's so many hype-related terms out there. </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:23'>There's artificial intelligence, there's data science. </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:26'>People google things and they get these crazy big formulas. </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:28'>But you know, really for me artificial intelligence </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:31'>is a very broad sort of philosophical sort of idea almost. </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:34'>Data science is like a collection of roles in a company, </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:36'>it feels like these days, </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:37'>but really this talk is about machine learning </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:39'>because there's, you know a subset of machine learning </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:41'>and that is really, really applicable to business. </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:44'>And I see machine learning as like a toolbox. </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:46'>We have a collection of problems that we can </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:48'>know how to solve, given certain datasets. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:01:51'>And so when we talk to people about a particular problem </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:53'>they might have, we sort of reach into this toolbox </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:55'>to try to find something that helps. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:01:58'>So we want to go through a bit of an example </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:01'>to start things off. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:02:02'>And so this is a bit of grounding. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:02:03'>I guess, you know, let's say we wanted </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:05'>to build a piece of machinery that predicts </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:07'>the price of a house. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:02:08'>So there's sort of a couple of different parts here we have. </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:11'>You know, we've got this robot in the middle </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:12'>that's somewhat representative of the software </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:16'>we want to write. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:02:16'>I'm going to call that a model. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:02:17'>And what that model does is tries to map </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:19'>between things that we might know about a house, </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:22'>like these sort of things: distance to the city, </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:24'>maybe what the house is made of, </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:25'>how old it is, and try to predict from those things </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:28'>what a sale price might be, </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:29'>say if it went to auction next week. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:02:31'>So the question becomes like, how do we do that? </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:33'>How do we build a bit of software </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:35'>that does this sort of thing? </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:36'>Well, in a lot of machine learning use cases, </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:40'>we use a technique that's called </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:41'>supervised machine learning. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:02:42'>It's called supervise because we sort of train this model. </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:44'>We supervise it by giving an examples of things </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:47'>that we sort of know the answer for. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:02:49'>So what we sort of do is we collect </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:51'>some sort of a priori info about a whole bunch of houses </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:54'>that we might know the price for. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:02:56'>And then the problem becomes not to directly learn </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:00'>or to specify this sort of mapping </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:02'>between these things we know and the price, </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:04'>but to more give examples to a piece of machinery </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:07'>that might then be able to learn for itself. </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:10'>So the really important part about this is </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:12'>that it's all conditioned on the idea </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:13'>that we have access to this data. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:03:15'>And so there's this interesting relationship </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:17'>that'll be a thread that we talk about during this talk, </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:19'>which is different data that we have access to </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:23'>results in a different model. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:03:24'>And that's a really important critical thing, </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:26'>because for a lot of software we write </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:28'>it's very deterministic, sort of have </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:30'>a really good control of things, </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:32'>but this dependency machine learning of a particular dataset </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:35'>can really be critical to success. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:03:37'>And also how sort of things work in general. </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:40'>So what we're going to talk about first is </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:42'>the idea of technical feasibility. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:03:43'>Let's explore some of those things I mentioned, </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:45'>the idea of datasets and models, sort of complexity. </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:49'>This slide we've got sort of these two axes. </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:53'>This is a common sort of way </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:54'>that I think about machine learning, </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:55'>this idea about what sort of data we have </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:57'>and how much we have, and how what I call complex </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:01'>the model is, like what sort of capacity that model has. </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:04'>You can think of it like how big </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:05'>is the piece of machinery is brain. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:04:08'>And there's this really interesting relationship </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:09'>which I think is quite intuitive </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:10'>that in general is a big rule of thumb </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:13'>that says the more data we have available on a problem, </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:16'>the better result we're going to get </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:18'>from this piece of machine learning. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:04:20'>So that's really critical because it means that </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:22'>we don't sort of ever build one piece of machine learning. </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:25'>It's not like we instal the machine learning model </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:28'>and it's sort of done. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:04:29'>It's very much an iterative process </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:30'>where as we collect more data </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:32'>or we make the data more complicated </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:34'>we have the opportunity to sort of rebuild this model </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:37'>in some way to sort of ask from the model </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:40'>more and more complicated questions. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:04:43'>So there's a couple of different dimensions </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:45'>that play in here. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:04:46'>This idea that more data means a better result in some way. </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:49'>What does more data mean? </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:50'>Well, if I think about this table of data here, </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:52'>this idea about things that represent a house </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:54'>that I'm trying to predict from, </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:56'>the simplest one, in terms of more data, </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:58'>it's just more rows, simply more examples of houses </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:00'>when we know the prices. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:05:01'>That's a really clear way of getting more data, </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:03'>and that feels intuitive </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:04'>because the more sort of examples you see of something </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:07'>the better the result might be </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:08'>in terms of how will we generalise to new things. </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:11'>Another interesting dimension of this data is </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:13'>you can think about the comps, </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:15'>like what sort of things do we know about each house? </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:17'>In this example, we've got things like how far it is </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:19'>from the city or what it's made of, </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:21'>but you could also imagine that there's a bunch </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:23'>of stuff which helps us predict the price, </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:25'>like how many bedrooms there are, </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:26'>or does this house have a pool. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:05:28'>So there's also this idea about </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:29'>what sort of information we have on each house. </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:33'>And that's on the data side, </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:34'>I think what's more interesting in relationship </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:37'>to the product is the idea of the complexity of the model. </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:39'>And that's often, not always, but often </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:41'>driven by the complexity of the answer we're trying to get. </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:45'>So in this case, we're talking about </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:46'>what's the predicted sale of a house next week or something. </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:50'>But it might be that the data we've collected </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:52'>or the type of question we're asking </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:55'>can't be necessarily answered from this dataset. </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:58'>So we have a lot of flexibility on this right-hand side, </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:01'>this output side to ask different questions of the data. </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:05'>So maybe this data is really good for saying </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:08'>how many days is it going to take to sell this house </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:10'>that went onto the market, </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:11'>or maybe even a more granular question, </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:13'>or less granular, like will this house </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:15'>sell in the next month? </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:17'>So this complexity of the question we have is also important </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:20'>because the less complex the question we have, </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:23'>the less data we have to have to build a model. </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:27'>So, when we're thinking about products and machine learning, </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:30'>it's important to think about, </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:31'>can we if we need to reframe our question? </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:34'>Is there a simpler version of the question </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:36'>we're trying to ask the machine learning </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:37'>that gives us a better result? </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:39'>And so it's a thing that we have to trade off a lot. </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:42'>As we get more data either by purely number of rows </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:47'>or more complicated data, we can start to ask </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:49'>more complicated questions of the machinery. </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:52'>And I think another thing that's critical </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:54'>that people don't realise is that it's not </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:56'>just one machine learning model in a company. </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:58'>It's not like we instal </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:59'>one piece of software that does this. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:07:01'>We end up with lots and lots and lots of these models </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:05'>that sort of interact in complicated ways. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:07:06'>And it's never just one input and one output. </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:09'>We might have some input which goes to a model, </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:11'>which becomes output, which becomes input for another model. </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:14'>And all of these things might be doing different things </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:17'>with different responsibilities. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:07:18'>And so it's quite complicated, but it's never the case </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:20'>that it's just one single model sitting off to the side. </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:26'>So, if we think about this idea of different types of models </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:29'>and different data requirements that happen, </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:32'>there's quite a continuum </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:33'>of where does this model come from? </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:35'>You know, a while ago, it used to be </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:36'>that you were sort of on your own </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:38'>and you'd have to build this thing from scratch, </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:40'>but more and more as common questions asked of common data, </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:44'>this becomes more and more a commodity in a sense. </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:47'>And nowadays there's cloud services that we can use </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:49'>that very easily represent things </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:51'>that 10 years ago were very difficult to build. </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:54'>So you've got a choice to go with. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:07:57'>Do I just use an existing cloud service, </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:58'>which is maybe trivial to use, </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:00'>and it has some very, very low cost, </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:02'>but doesn't give you any differentiation across the market? </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:05'>The other end of this is if you have </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:06'>very unique data in some way, </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:09'>or a very unique type of question of that data, </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:11'>you might have to build something </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:12'>a little more bold bespoke. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:08:14'>And, you know, there's a big continuum between. </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:16'>You don't have to necessarily just use the cloud service. </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:18'>You might use something that they provide, </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:20'>and then sort of do some tuning on top of it </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:21'>to make it a little bit more specific to your dataset. </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:24'>And these things are very rapid </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:26'>and they change very quickly. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:08:27'>One of the best examples I know of this </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:29'>is this idea of object detection in an image. </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:32'>So here's an image. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:08:33'>Nowadays with computer vision </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:35'>we can draw these bounding boxes </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:37'>around salient objects in the image in real time. </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:40'>Now 10 years ago, people didn't even know how to do this. </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:42'>It was inconceivable that we could have this technology. </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:45'>Five years ago people were having to build </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:47'>complicated pipelines to do this. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:08:49'>These days, it's a small fraction of a cent. </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:51'>You send this image up to the cloud </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:53'>and you get something back. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:08:54'>So everyone has access to this now in some ways. </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:56'>So you've got this interesting balance </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:58'>between what is really quite a new technology </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:01'>and how do you integrate it, </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:02'>but how do you integrate it in a way </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:03'>that maybe is a little bit different to your competitors? </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:08'>The next we're going to go to customer value. </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:10'>- Okay, thanks Matt. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:09:11'>So I'm now going to look </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:12'>at the next product management lens, </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:14'>which is customer value. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:09:16'>So we're going to go back to the matrix </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:19'>that Matt talked us through earlier, </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:21'>and add another element, which is the bubble, </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:24'>which represents customer value. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:09:26'>So the first thing I'm going to say is pretty obvious, </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:29'>and it's just basic good product management, </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:31'>is that we should always be thinking </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:33'>about the value we deliver to customers. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:09:36'>But I think often because of the excitement we have </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:38'>around the technology for machine learning </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:42'>it's easy to lose sight of this. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:09:44'>And so what we're looking for is, </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:47'>as we tick tack up that matrix </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:50'>and both increase the size and complexity </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:53'>of the data estate and develop the model capacity </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:57'>we're looking for an increase in customer value </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:01'>that matches that investment. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:10:04'>And really importantly, we need to set a baseline </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:07'>at the beginning. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:10:08'>So before we even establish a machine learning experience </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:14'>we know what it would look like </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:16'>if it was a non-machine learning one. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:10:18'>So if it's a recommender, what happens if we just have </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:20'>a simple rules-based system that just says </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:23'>products in the same category </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:26'>at around the same price point? </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:27'>And that gives us the baseline </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:29'>for measuring that customer value. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:10:34'>And when we do that, we find that often </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:36'>there's a kind of sweet spot in the middle </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:40'>going from bottom left to top right. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:10:42'>And the most valuable thing we can do </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:46'>is to stay in that sweet spot </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:49'>and increase value as we add to the data estate, </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:53'>improve the model complexity. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:10:57'>We'll know when we're moving out of that </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:59'>because you're not increasing the customer value. </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:01'>So if that's on the horizontal axis, </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:04'>it might be that it's redundant data </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:06'>and you see really kind of extreme versions of this </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:09'>where organisations just hoard a lot of data </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:11'>that doesn't actually add value. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:11:13'>On the vertical axis it might look like over-investment </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:17'>in the model where you're doing something </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:20'>that's exciting from a machine learning perspective, </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:23'>but maybe isn't delivering the customer value. </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:26'>So with that in mind, we'll look at three </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:29'>anti-patterns that we see </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:32'>in trying to develop that customer value </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:35'>in line with the investment in the technology. </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:38'>So the first of them is a fairly obvious one, </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:40'>which we've called the stalled value trap. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:11:43'>And that's really just where </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:44'>you're no longer getting a growth in value. </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:46'>So you continuing to invest, </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:48'>you're moving across and upwards, </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:51'>but there's no increase in value. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:11:52'>At this point, we should stop and solve another problem, </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:55'>because there's so many opportunities </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:57'>that can be addressed with machine learning. </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:01'>The next one is the hype trap. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:12:04'>And I think this is common where the organisation </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:07'>or the founder or the CEO just really wants </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:09'>to see some machine learning implemented. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:12:12'>And what this can look like is that </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:14'>the non-machine learning solution </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:17'>is actually a pretty substantial value bubble. </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:21'>And the investment might eventually get us to it </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:25'>and maybe even slightly increase it, </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:27'>but it hasn't justified the cost that's required </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:31'>to get us there. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:12:32'>And then the last one, the moonshot, </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:36'>is perhaps not really an anti-pattern </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:37'>in that it's a valid choice, but it's important for us </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:42'>to consider whether it's right for the organisation. </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:46'>And what that looks like is that </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:48'>there's no payoff until there's been </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:50'>really substantial investment, </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:52'>lots of data and a real complexity in the model. </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:55'>So this might be things like autonomous driving </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:58'>and despite all the investment that the industry </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:01'>has put into that, we're still not there, </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:03'>but clearly a lot of great companies </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:05'>believe we're going to get there. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:13:06'>And they're prepared to take that moonshot. </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:11'>What we would counsel is that we should understand </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:14'>whether it's right for our organisation </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:16'>before embarking on it, because you don't want to stop </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:18'>until you've got to that top right corner. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:13:23'>So what we do advocate is a portfolio of approaches. </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:29'>And so, like you would have a a product portfolio </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:32'>for a set of products, it makes sense </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:35'>to have different investment approaches. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:13:38'>So that might be an incremental one, </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:41'>which if we go back to the automated vehicles example, </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:45'>maybe this is developing lane changing technology. </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:49'>And then meanwhile, another part of the portfolio, </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:51'>we're investing in a more moonshot approach, </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:54'>which is actually developing level one autonomy. </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:59'>Okay, so hopefully that's given a view </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:02'>of how customer value can be considered </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:05'>with machine learning. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:14:07'>The next thing we look at is commercial viability. </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:12'>So I'm gonna let's stick with the two axes </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:15'>that Matt introduced. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:14:17'>And the first one I'll look at is the horizontal axis, </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:21'>so the data estate. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:14:24'>And there's two the big costs that we want to explore, </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:28'>and I should drop a caveat here, which is mileage may vary. </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:33'>It's very hard for us to really talk </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:35'>with great confidence about cost, </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:38'>but we do see these two patterns. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:14:41'>So one is around the hardware costs and data storage. </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:46'>And this isn't significant in the early stages </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:50'>of developing the data estate. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:14:53'>So it only grows as we get towards the end of that axis </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:57'>when you're getting real high volume data, </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:00'>and particularly data that's been drawn off </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:02'>the actual use of the product. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:15:05'>The bigger cost is the people cost and in data engineering. </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:09'>So it's often the case that the data of the organisation </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:15'>isn't in a great state and you actually have to put </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:17'>a fairly big upfront investment </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:20'>in order to get it into a position </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:23'>where you can do anything. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:15:25'>So that's the horizontal axis. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:15:27'>The vertical axis, in terms of developing </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:31'>the model capacity. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:15:33'>Again, we can look at it in those two pieces, </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:36'>the people and the hardware costs. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:15:38'>This is the probably one good news </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:41'>on the cost slide is it may be free </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:45'>to get to that very first step. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:15:48'>So as Matt said, machine learning as a service </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:50'>may be an important cost </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:52'>in order to get that basic experience. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:15:55'>You're then likely to incur some people costs </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:59'>in order to to implement a more generic model, </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:04'>but then you will see it really blow out </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:08'>into that custom space, </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:09'>so where you're actually trying to develop </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:11'>something that's original. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:16:13'>It's high risk and likely high cost. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:16:16'>On the hardware side, the compute costs grow </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:21'>as you move up that axis in a fairly linear kind of way. </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:26'>So, that's commercial viability. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:16:29'>Let's move on to the next classic product lens, </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:34'>which is usability. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:16:37'>So usability in is obviously really going to depend </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:40'>on what the application you're building is. </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:43'>But there's a pattern that I think </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:45'>is worth noting that we think applies </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:48'>to most machine learning based products. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:16:51'>And that's the idea of having an interface </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:54'>that's robust to failure. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:16:56'>So, there's always the challenge </span> <span data-startTime='00:17:00'>of developing the machine learning experience </span> <span data-startTime='00:17:05'>up those two axes. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:17:09'>And it's important that the UI you create </span> <span data-startTime='00:17:14'>reflects where you are. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:17:16'>So the example that we've got here </span> <span data-startTime='00:17:19'>is from the YouTube recommender, </span> <span data-startTime='00:17:21'>and what it does is it doesn't presume </span> <span data-startTime='00:17:25'>to completely solve the user's problem </span> <span data-startTime='00:17:28'>of what's the next video I should watch. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:17:30'>It kind of augments that experience. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:17:33'>So it says on the right, here's half a dozen videos </span> <span data-startTime='00:17:36'>that might be relevant. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:17:37'>And it mixes in different alternatives there. </span> <span data-startTime='00:17:42'>So that if the user is interested in just straight football, </span> <span data-startTime='00:17:45'>or broader sport, or humour, or a particular player, </span> <span data-startTime='00:17:48'>they've got options and they can choose </span> <span data-startTime='00:17:52'>from that augmented experience. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:17:55'>As we get more confident </span> <span data-startTime='00:17:57'>with the machine learning experience </span> <span data-startTime='00:17:59'>we can be more presumptuous </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:02'>in terms of the interface we build. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:18:04'>And so the auto-play features is example of that, </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:08'>where we see that as up on the top right </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:11'>of the matrix where we really automating, </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:14'>and rather than just augmenting that navigation, </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:17'>we're actually saying we think this is the one video </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:20'>that you should watch next. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:18:22'>So those are the four classic lenses </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:26'>that people like Maddy Cagan would talk about. </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:28'>The other two things we want to cover: </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:31'>what's the strategic context, </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:33'>and then what's the delivery context. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:18:35'>So I'll do the strategy piece. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:18:37'>One of the things that makes machine learning very exciting </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:41'>from a strategic point of view </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:43'>is this double flywheel effect that we see. </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:47'>So a lot of products will have the flywheel </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:51'>that you can see in the centre, </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:53'>which is that they create a good experience, </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:58'>this drives usage, which then generates revenue, </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:01'>which they can then invest in improving that experience </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:05'>and that attracts more usage. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:19:08'>So that kind of revenue based flywheel </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:10'>is common to a lot of products. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:19:12'>What's interesting about machine learning </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:14'>is that it then has this second flywheel, </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:16'>which comes from the unique data that is generated </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:20'>from that usage. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:19:22'>So by using that product, it creates unique data </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:25'>that only this product has access to, </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:30'>which can then be fed into the model innovation, </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:33'>which further develops the experience </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:35'>and hopefully generates more usage. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:19:39'>And the wheel continues to turn. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:19:42'>So that's why from a strategic point of view, </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:44'>getting there first with a machine learning product </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:48'>can create this unassailable competitive advantage. </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:53'>And with that in mind, it's interesting to look </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:56'>at what we think of the two main categories </span> <span data-startTime='00:20:00'>of machine learning opportunities. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:20:03'>So the first one is about value creation. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:20:06'>And the definition of this is where </span> <span data-startTime='00:20:08'>you're actually building a new product experience </span> <span data-startTime='00:20:10'>using the machine learning technology. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:20:13'>So examples might be voice or self-driving vehicles. </span> <span data-startTime='00:20:19'>And this is interesting because there's </span> <span data-startTime='00:20:21'>this real potential for the flywheel. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:20:24'>And given that potential, there's value </span> <span data-startTime='00:20:26'>in getting there first. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:20:28'>So there is some urgency, but there's also risky, </span> <span data-startTime='00:20:32'>and there's that moonshot risk that we talked about earlier. </span> <span data-startTime='00:20:36'>The alternative place to look </span> <span data-startTime='00:20:39'>for those value opportunities are around efficiency. </span> <span data-startTime='00:20:42'>So that's reducing costs and improving efficiency. </span> <span data-startTime='00:20:46'>That might be things like fraud detection. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:20:49'>It's more incremental. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:20:50'>You're more confident that you'll succeed, </span> <span data-startTime='00:20:52'>but it's less likely to have that flywheel effect </span> <span data-startTime='00:20:55'>that creates the urgency, but also the really big payoff. </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:01'>So the final piece we'd like to talk about is delivery. </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:04'>And I'll hand back to Matt for that. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:21:07'>- So there's a couple of different patterns </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:09'>and ways of working that we've seen </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:11'>in companies that are either small or large, </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:13'>and it sort of follows two axes. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:21:15'>The horizontal axes here, it talks about </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:18'>the complexity of the machine learning that's being used. </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:21'>And I really like this series of terms </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:24'>that comes from quite old statistics, </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:25'>this idea of descriptive, prescriptive, or predictive, </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:31'>different versions of machine learning. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:21:33'>So descriptive statistics is when </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:36'>we're building things like dashboards. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:21:37'>So if I have a large amount of data </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:39'>and I want to sort of summarise it in some way </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:41'>that I can aid humans in their decision-making. </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:44'>So, you know, big dashboards showing graphs, </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:47'>the distillation of complicated data into small data, </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:49'>that's the descriptive statistics. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:21:51'>And people will often move from that </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:53'>to this idea of predictive. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:21:55'>If I've got a whole bunch of data, then, </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:57'>it's really handy for a business to be able </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:59'>to predict the future. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:21:59'>So this is where a lot of the first </span> <span data-startTime='00:22:01'>dipping of the toes in machine learning comes in. </span> <span data-startTime='00:22:04'>Can I predict some of the things </span> <span data-startTime='00:22:05'>that are in these descriptive statistics, </span> <span data-startTime='00:22:06'>because if I know about them in the future, </span> <span data-startTime='00:22:08'>it's really handy. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:22:09'>And often as you get better and better at this, </span> <span data-startTime='00:22:10'>why do you want to predict the future? </span> <span data-startTime='00:22:12'>It's because you want to sort of change some leavers </span> <span data-startTime='00:22:14'>upstream in your system. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:22:15'>You want to be able to change things that are happening </span> <span data-startTime='00:22:18'>so that you can say that my predictive model says </span> <span data-startTime='00:22:20'>we'd make more money if I made more, </span> <span data-startTime='00:22:22'>say, widgets now than tomorrow, </span> <span data-startTime='00:22:23'>I should make widgets now. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:22:25'>And so the third round of this which is a little bit rarer </span> <span data-startTime='00:22:28'>is this idea of prescriptive, </span> <span data-startTime='00:22:30'>where we're actually handing over some aspect </span> <span data-startTime='00:22:32'>of the business to this machinery to act on our behalf. </span> <span data-startTime='00:22:35'>They're the three ways that we see the complexity growing. </span> <span data-startTime='00:22:39'>There's also this idea about who in the company is doing it. </span> <span data-startTime='00:22:42'>You know, it's very common that because this is </span> <span data-startTime='00:22:44'>quite technically challenging, </span> <span data-startTime='00:22:45'>there's maybe a single team, </span> <span data-startTime='00:22:47'>maybe some sort of centre of excellence </span> <span data-startTime='00:22:49'>that's sort of starting with this. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:22:51'>And eventually they might grow </span> <span data-startTime='00:22:52'>into some sort of cross team capability, </span> <span data-startTime='00:22:54'>or there might be some sort of mandate </span> <span data-startTime='00:22:55'>from a very high tech company to do this company-wide. </span> <span data-startTime='00:22:59'>And, you know, there's three arrows we've drawn on here </span> <span data-startTime='00:23:01'>that are sort of interesting ways of doing this. </span> <span data-startTime='00:23:04'>And two of them are in a way, failure modes. </span> <span data-startTime='00:23:06'>This arrow that's going straight up, </span> <span data-startTime='00:23:08'>this idea of descriptive statistics </span> <span data-startTime='00:23:10'>that are across the company. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:23:12'>This is very common. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:23:13'>We've got a lot of teams that are doing simple things, </span> <span data-startTime='00:23:15'>so to speak, and maybe failing is a bit harsh there. </span> <span data-startTime='00:23:18'>It's basically the first step that we see. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:23:22'>One of the other areas we've got here </span> <span data-startTime='00:23:23'>is this one that's completely horizontal. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:23:25'>That's this idea that there's a single team </span> <span data-startTime='00:23:27'>that are doing very complicated things, </span> <span data-startTime='00:23:28'>have deep expertise in an area, </span> <span data-startTime='00:23:31'>but they're the only people doing it. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:23:33'>And this is a big mode of failure. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:23:35'>Having a few people that are able to do amazing things, </span> <span data-startTime='00:23:37'>but no one else is really not a long-term way to do this. </span> <span data-startTime='00:23:41'>So the ideal state is this diagonal, </span> <span data-startTime='00:23:43'>this idea that maybe you grow single teams </span> <span data-startTime='00:23:45'>doing simple things, but you really want </span> <span data-startTime='00:23:47'>this capability across the world. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:23:50'>And one of the best ways of doing this </span> <span data-startTime='00:23:51'>is this idea of capturing that expertise, </span> <span data-startTime='00:23:54'>not necessarily always in people, but in tools and process. </span> <span data-startTime='00:23:57'>So it's a very important point to make. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:23:59'>And that is the end of our talk. </span> </p>

		<p><span data-startTime='00:00:00'>(upbeat music) </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:10'>- Hi everyone, my name is Albert, </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:12'>I'm currently the Head of Growth at Vero. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:00:15'>Today, I'm gonna talk about Love Triangle, </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:17'>Product, Data and Growth. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:00:20'>First of all, I wanna go through who am I. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:00:23'>Throughout my career of seven years, </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:26'>I've been like working with a lot of lifestyle set up </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:29'>from early day into Syria, </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:31'>into scaling up states across different countries, </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:34'>and across different industry from marketplace to e-commerce </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:38'>to mobile app, to SAS, </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:41'>and, and that's where I get all experience </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:43'>from different country, from Vietnam, </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:45'>Singapore and Australia. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:00:47'>And, and throughout my career, </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:49'>I also had the opportunity to work across </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:51'>different types of skill sets from wire framing, </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:54'>landing page to growth marketing, </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:57'>SEO, conversion optimization, </span> <span data-startTime='00:00:59'>and up to now, </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:00'>I've been more focusing on marketing automation, </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:02'>product marketing and product led growth, </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:05'>and which is also the main topic </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:07'>for today we're gonna go through. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:01:09'>First of all, so let's go though like the Love story here. </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:13'>This is saying that, three is a crowd </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:16'>and in this case is product data and growth </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:19'>with the background in tech and data </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:21'>and working in growth marketing </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:23'>for why moving to work more product growth recently, </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:26'>I have worked with a lot of startup </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:28'>and experienced a lot of like pushback </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:29'>from the product team against growth. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:01:32'>And also a lot of times and then also have the ignorance </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:35'>against data in the product team, </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:37'>as in they not tracking data enough, </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:38'>or they are missing a lot of like important data </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:41'>they should be looking at. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:01:42'>And that leads to the fact that those three team </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:45'>tend to not work well together at all. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:01:48'>And a lot of these challenge </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:50'>and issues usually comes from like this, </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:52'>like the misconception about growth is, </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:55'>and hear some of the like common </span> <span data-startTime='00:01:57'>like misunderstanding about growth. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:02:00'>So from my experience in my career </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:02'>what growth is not, is what growth is not </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:06'>about like one trick pony or quick fix </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:07'>that can help you to grow substantially overnight. </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:11'>It's not just about like random tests, </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:13'>like find on internet or some of the best practise </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:16'>you can pick up here and there. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:02:17'>And it's just not just about a guesswork, </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:19'>you just think this my work </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:21'>because someone told me about this idea </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:24'>and it's not just about </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:25'>like, Top of the Funnel and acquisition. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:02:27'>(stertor sound) </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:29'>But growth, what growth actually about is that </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:31'>it's about long-term </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:32'>and sustainable growth for the whole company, </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:36'>for the product, and for the whole team, </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:38'>and it's also based, should be based on calculated </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:41'>and prioritised experiment based on data and fact. </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:44'>So the example here is that at Glam Corner, </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:46'>after four years joining them, </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:48'>I help them to grow the monthly revenue by 45 times </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:51'>by the end of, by time I left, left the company. </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:55'>And then not only that growth is about like lifecycle, </span> <span data-startTime='00:02:58'>full funnel user journey not just how to funnel, </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:01'>like the misconception before. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:03:03'>So we focus on from the start to the end </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:05'>from activation, retention, referral and reactivation </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:10'>and growth is about product life and data driven. </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:12'>So the example here is, </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:14'>that by the time I left Glam Corner </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:16'>I have helped to grow the returning transaction </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:19'>rate by 4.5 times. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:03:21'>So this mean every month, </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:23'>more than half of the transaction's are </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:24'>coming from the returning customer </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:26'>to a lot of work on retention, improving user experience </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:28'>and also not just on a website, </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:30'>but on the on the channels as well. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:03:33'>And other common mistakes I have observed </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:37'>and experienced between the product </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:40'>and data and growth team are: </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:44'>So a lot of time like they prioritise </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:46'>and make decision based on opinions </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:48'>instead of data and fact. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:03:50'>They just blindly copy best practises </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:52'>from someone else's successful experiments </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:55'>that might not even apply to them. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:03:57'>And the next case when like a lot of, </span> <span data-startTime='00:03:59'>like I mentioned before the product </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:01'>and growth silo between teams </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:04'>and the growth team we don't have a seat </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:06'>at the product table in the monthly discussion </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:09'>on product growth roadmap feature and prioritisation. </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:13'>The last two are, a lot of teams </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:15'>they kind of lay low emphasis on data. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:04:17'>So from day one, sometimes they don't track any data at all </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:20'>or they forget about like data tracking on in the early days </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:24'>that leads to the fact that later down the track </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:26'>we didn't need to start track some important data. </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:28'>They have to wait to collect data </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:30'>or missing out a lot of important insight </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:33'>and sometimes even ignore either </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:35'>or both of the quantitative and qualitative data. </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:39'>And I just want to go quickly </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:41'>to some of the example here by like the common mistakes. </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:44'>So in this case, I say that, </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:45'>one of client I work with, </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:46'>so I look, I put them to do the BI tool </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:49'>and then for the previous team, </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:51'>they have different calculations </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:52'>with GMV levy, different version, instead </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:54'>of just like writing off for the change. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:04:56'>They just have all of the version there </span> <span data-startTime='00:04:58'>and whenever there's a new person coming in </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:00'>they have no idea which version is correct one. </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:02'>So this lead to like the loss of trust in the data </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:07'>and this messy data and impact the decision making a lot. </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:10'>And there's no single source of truth on this case. </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:12'>And the other example is like they, </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:14'>they had other setup they had pentane incited data </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:15'>and aware sort been around one year </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:19'>but they haven't set tracking data even in a database. </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:22'>So, so in this case they use a table </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:24'>and they don't even track when they use the jaundice </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:26'>the fluff from our adult when they sign up, </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:29'>so that they create is totally empty. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:05:30'>So they have no idea for the past one year </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:33'>when users signed up </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:33'>and it's hard to track and maybe attribute </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:36'>and look at how you just behave over time. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:05:38'>So now they have stats track that from like from scratch. </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:42'>So that's one like very big problem for this setup. </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:46'>And then three is a crowd, </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:48'>but then photocopier solutions. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:05:50'>So in this case, when you put the user </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:52'>as the car and owned up the cross strategy, </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:55'>data insight and product central around </span> <span data-startTime='00:05:58'>like adding value to user, what the user needs </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:01'>and user want. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:06:02'>What are important to the user </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:04'>that can help you a lot, the strategy </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:06'>and the focus of the three team product data and growth. </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:10'>And that led to the main part of our talk today </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:13'>about prioritisation </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:16'>and how do we prioritise future project </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:19'>and strategy that bring product data </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:21'>and growth team together with focus on user. </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:25'>So first from the product perspective. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:06:28'>So like a lot many of the modern product team </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:32'>and communities that have been prioritising the </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:34'>product roadmap project and future this way, </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:38'>based on like a few, many like key factor. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:06:41'>And usually they start with the objective. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:06:44'>So this usually come from the company current strategy </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:47'>and growth, objective and goals. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:06:51'>It varies by company, industry, business models </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:53'>and depending on what the company's trying </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:55'>to achieve this year, so this quarter </span> <span data-startTime='00:06:58'>and next day was like statue. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:06:59'>Like each of those idea, they look at, in this case drive </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:03'>over in the growth perspective called Funnel. </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:05'>So like of each of those like features would part </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:08'>of the funnel impacting the user, the scoring, issue </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:11'>like those like factor. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:07:12'>And next slide of routine we look at the efforts </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:15'>so how easy it is to implement </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:17'>and build those feature for the user. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:07:20'>And last but not least, </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:21'>So it would be based on the things you care about </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:24'>the user impact score. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:07:26'>In this case, they the scores getting how many user </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:29'>like vote on our photos idea </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:32'>in the product feedback platform. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:07:36'>And then from there, that's where they get the </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:39'>process session score to have them to like </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:42'>decide what to do next for next month or next quarter. </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:46'>And he not like the four common </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:48'>like software that the product team </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:51'>are using to do this calculation brutalization. </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:56'>Then, what about growth? </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:57'>So the growth like we don't have like any fancy, </span> <span data-startTime='00:07:59'>less solution or software to do this </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:02'>more like, like productive way. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:08:05'>And so that's what I come up with </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:06'>like my own solution to like prioritise </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:08'>the growth experiments </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:10'>so that it allows the productive team and can easily explain </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:12'>to you product team, </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:13'>have them to you live with their strategy. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:08:16'>So as you may have known, </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:18'>so that's the common frameworks out there </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:20'>as frameworked taking into account impact, </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:23'>Confidence and Ease. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:08:24'>And the other one is like Rice scoring. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:08:27'>So for me, like I still </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:29'>like two based on a lot of assumption, </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:32'>like one of few people is just got an idea based </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:35'>on the impact or the Confident </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:37'>of what they think about the Ease outdoors idea. </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:40'>And this is not data driven and this </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:42'>like doesn't bring in Confident for the user </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:44'>and still based on assumption of one, a few people </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:46'>and that is not a key part for success and for the Rice. </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:50'>So that's a bit of like improvement from there as in </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:53'>they will take into account model a data day to </span> <span data-startTime='00:08:56'>calculate the written impact, formula. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:08:59'>I feel like that's still not enough. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:09:01'>And this collect, like assume that once I fit all. </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:04'>So like for me, from my experience </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:06'>like every startup is different, </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:08'>their business model, </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:09'>the operation model, </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:11'>whether it's marketplace, </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:12'>e-commerce, SAS, PGC, B2C, their own different </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:15'>and one formula cannot be like applied to all of them. </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:19'>So it does lead to the fact that I have to like looking at </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:22'>for like the solution to customise this framework </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:25'>in a way that's more flexible </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:27'>and can be like a tailor to different startup </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:31'>and different business model. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:09:33'>So this is how, like </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:34'>I been doing this for different startup, right now. </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:38'>So, you may feel overwhelming, but don't worry. </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:40'>We are going to go through a break data </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:42'>this Coloured a framework one by one </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:44'>how are we gonna achieve this </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:46'>and how we calculate to like, get into this stage </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:48'>for our prioritisation. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:09:52'>And the main part here is that instead of, </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:54'>for other like growth micro added </span> <span data-startTime='00:09:56'>I think we already had the core idea. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:09:58'>They look it up on internet for the best practise formula. </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:01'>It's all have to start </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:02'>with like the problem hypothesis. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:10:03'>So like, so I'm the user research or data </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:06'>what you know about like the problem the user are facing </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:10'>and how it can be improved. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:10:11'>So always start with the problem hypothesis first </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:13'>in one column next you look at like, so from there </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:17'>like what's somebody's idea that can help to </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:19'>achieve a solve those problems. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:10:20'>So that's why one, like problem hypothesis </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:23'>can have multiple idea to achieve that. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:10:25'>Next, so we can categorise them based </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:27'>on what part of funnel that belong to, </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:30'>whether it's impacting the whole website </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:32'>or just the onboarding experience </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:34'>or the retention referral of so on. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:10:36'>So that in this way, it could lie </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:37'>with the production roadmap process station </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:40'>you, we saw earlier, I was, I've had them </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:43'>the product teams you've kind of understand </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:44'>and align with their strategy in the future. </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:47'>And this next part is the exciting one. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:10:49'>So how are we going to start calculate the </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:51'>scoring the process station of this idea? </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:54'>So I'm applying the PI frameworks. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:10:56'>So that means like Potential Impact and Ease. </span> <span data-startTime='00:10:59'>And it's, this is like slight iteration based on the Rice </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:03'>and the Rice, what we saw earlier, and we're going to work </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:06'>to how we calculate each of these metric. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:11:11'>So, first of all, so like the, for the Potential. </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:16'>So from this perspective is still similar to our framework. </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:19'>So we still look, take into your account, </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:21'>like the perspective of the stakeholders, </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:23'>who are validating the impact, </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:25'>the potential of this idea has gone make the impact on the, </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:29'>the business on the, the platform or the app. </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:33'>And next the impact is wave actually we can do more </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:37'>about the data, about the fact of the test </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:40'>or what, what device is gonna impact </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:42'>what page group you're going to impact </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:44'>and the user type, user group, user segmentation. </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:48'>So it will end when we punch in </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:49'>we're gonna see, like this adding on impact on this product </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:52'>the website and from the economy with the result </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:54'>and the score up the impact itself. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:11:56'>And we don't worry, we going to go straight </span> <span data-startTime='00:11:58'>in how to calculate them in the next few slides </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:01'>and ease so it will be similar to our other two framework. </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:04'>But in here I break it out further </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:06'>into ease we had to think about our team </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:09'>as well as the dev team, </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:10'>the design team and the contentor </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:12'>how is it is to view </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:15'>prototype and release this feature. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:12:17'>So it's important to actually take into account those three, </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:20'>not just maybe only text </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:22'>so that's usually not enough at all, for sure. </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:24'>And that's how we get into the scoring here to prioritise. </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:28'>I can see it's more granular </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:29'>because you look into like the factor of autonomous scoring. </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:32'>So in this way, happy to prioritise more accurately </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:35'>and have to, don't have to make assumption </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:38'>when this about scoring and the same, </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:39'>because for the RQ framework </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:41'>when I use a lot of the time </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:42'>they will produce the same story </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:44'>and they had to guess again </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:45'>which one helped you work on first, but this one </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:48'>we more data driven and easier to make decision. </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:51'>So next, let's go </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:52'>to how we can calculate the impact value here. </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:54'>So, first of all, like to do this, you have to </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:57'>for each of those startup, like I said </span> <span data-startTime='00:12:59'>they own different and no setup is the same. </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:02'>So first of all, you have to define a grouping </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:04'>and this callback form. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:13:06'>And because we have to think about like </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:07'>what we can add a page and three grouping </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:10'>for your flat form or website, what type of device you have </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:14'>it's just a website that will be just desktop mobile, </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:16'>you have mobile app and taken to care of like a Android, </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:20'>iOS are the channels as well, </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:22'>and use the tie. And in here with us where you're breaking </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:25'>down to like, depending on your business. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:13:26'>So it have supplant the email </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:28'>and marketplace as an editor and viewer, like in the SAS </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:31'>and whether it's like a buyer </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:36'>brands like for e-commerce. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:13:38'>So looking into different user type </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:39'>and looking to use a segment as well, </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:41'>new and returning user. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:13:43'>And then you also can look </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:44'>for the down into like user group, whether </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:46'>this feature can impact the pay user free user or everyone. </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:49'>So when you start, you'll have a list of </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:51'>on of the book that you wanted, </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:53'>you calculate and categorise the idea into </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:56'>then the next step is start to restart a key metrics. </span> <span data-startTime='00:13:59'>So next slide depends on your business. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:14:02'>You can like take into view, like either just </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:04'>like view for the page or the screen of the app </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:07'>or unique visitor or conversion and revenue. </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:10'>In this case, the example is the photo album mobile app. </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:14'>So the key metric for them is like how people actually land </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:18'>on the screen to showcase the volume of the </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:19'>and the demand of the screen. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:14:21'>It is how much user can impact. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:14:23'>So we'll look at the screen </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:24'>and sometimes it could be limited </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:25'>by the current app of tracking that you have. </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:28'>So in this case, I picked a screen for this example. </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:31'>For our case, like Connnar, the e-commerce one </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:34'>look at revenue, that's what matters to them the most </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:37'>and we look through all the pages </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:39'>or the property by revenue instead. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:14:40'>So let's go through with the view here. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:14:42'>So we based on the use, like the tool you have, </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:45'>and you just need to like look, </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:47'>work with the data team to dig into the data </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:49'>for each of those grouping </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:50'>how much data it belongs to each of these group </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:52'>usually try to look at like, </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:54'>a year of data so that you have a full cycle </span> <span data-startTime='00:14:57'>of data to make sure you don't have any skewed data </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:00'>because seasonality or other factor </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:02'>or maybe some PR that spike up and down. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:15:04'>That's why important to get enough like division data, </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:07'>meaning the sample size in this case. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:15:10'>And next one, you have those calculation. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:15:12'>What you do next is to calculate the impact score </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:15'>for each of these groupings. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:15:17'>It's just simple let you get the value of that calculate </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:20'>and then divided by the total value for that group. </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:23'>And then you just times by 10 </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:25'>because once you calculate based on the scoring up 10 </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:28'>that's where you get the scoring </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:29'>for the impact in this case. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:15:32'>And next one is going to be the cut is a one select, </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:35'>how do you get these scoring </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:37'>for potential and ease value? </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:38'>So in this case, instead of just like myself </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:40'>or the, the executive team, like score the Potential </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:44'>and Ease with crowdsource idea </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:47'>from like my other team members, </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:48'>where we let them submit the scoring for Potential and Ease </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:52'>and let the dev team less submit the, the Ease scoring </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:56'>for the owner of the technical perspective for ideas </span> <span data-startTime='00:15:59'>same for design, same content team. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:16:01'>This way, we've been invited by us </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:03'>and on up the other like skewed data index calculation. </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:07'>The final part I want to touch quickly on is like </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:10'>when you have those scoring </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:11'>then where do you get those added from. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:16:13'>So easily again, </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:14'>I have to be based on like the metric. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:16:16'>And in this case, we can look at like the other </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:19'>like growth related metric, </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:20'>leading metric, lagging metric </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:22'>or we'll look at production UX metric, </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:24'>like the qualitative data, quantitative data </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:27'>in this case where you can drift </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:29'>and dive in more, say in the future. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:16:32'>And in terms of the data maturity </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:33'>where you can get the data from is at a basic </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:36'>or we can get the traffic data </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:37'>from Google Analytics to get those </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:39'>like calculation for the impact I mentioned earlier. </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:42'>And then for quality of data, I can look </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:44'>at the different tools for heat map session recording. </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:46'>You see what add a user problem, use a penned upon </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:49'>that they having such come up, assumption, hypothesis </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:53'>and then you can start to like validate those assumptions </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:56'>with more quantitative data based on behavioural tracking, </span> <span data-startTime='00:16:59'>what is click screen data from this tool </span> <span data-startTime='00:17:01'>to look into whether user truly perform this behaviour </span> <span data-startTime='00:17:04'>because sometimes what they do and what they say </span> <span data-startTime='00:17:07'>at totally different from user perspective and </span> <span data-startTime='00:17:10'>and the other final stage that they can, </span> <span data-startTime='00:17:12'>where you can start to aggregate data from multiple source </span> <span data-startTime='00:17:15'>and it, into one place using like dashboarding tool </span> <span data-startTime='00:17:18'>or BI tool so that you can democratise access to data </span> <span data-startTime='00:17:21'>for the whole team. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:17:22'>So everyone can have access to data to make the decision </span> <span data-startTime='00:17:25'>and have come up with their own assumption hypothesis </span> <span data-startTime='00:17:28'>so that they can submit the idea as well. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:17:30'>And the other part is that from the quality perspective </span> <span data-startTime='00:17:34'>a lot of product team, they just like usually focus too much </span> <span data-startTime='00:17:37'>on like the in-app like feedback. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:17:39'>So when after user already locked in </span> <span data-startTime='00:17:41'>when they do an onboarding activation, pop-up after. </span> <span data-startTime='00:17:44'>So after they forgot </span> <span data-startTime='00:17:45'>about like the feedback from the marketing side. </span> <span data-startTime='00:17:48'>So what used to do the, before they log in </span> <span data-startTime='00:17:51'>when it's browsing, before a signup. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:17:53'>So a lot of feedback that as a very valuable </span> <span data-startTime='00:17:56'>and can be grouped with out of feedback </span> <span data-startTime='00:17:57'>like when they log in as well. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:18:00'>And in this case develop also more </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:02'>than the feedback you can get </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:03'>from the onboarding and activation. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:18:06'>So when you work hand in hand between </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:08'>like production growth teams collect </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:09'>the feedback flow like ideas. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:18:10'>You have more of a connector, seamless and cohesive journey </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:14'>for the user and also can minimise the fit, the </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:17'>the overlapping and what, Oh, well </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:19'>overwhelming user up to many communication of feedback </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:22'>whether you choose to get feedback </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:23'>from an in-app survey or email through a live chat </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:24'>and pop-up. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:18:29'>And this is where I take it to like, </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:31'>we own up those access to data </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:33'>you give to your team member and a different department, </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:37'>they can come up with like a lot of amazing idea </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:40'>'cause from my perspective ideas, </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:41'>can come from one or two person </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:43'>but it's about home teamwork. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:18:45'>And when they can, like submit idea that you have, </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:48'>they have to have experience </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:49'>when they work with the user </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:51'>then can help us to like pick a better idea, </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:54'>and prioritise them using the framework we looked through </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:57'>and at the end so what you can do is you </span> <span data-startTime='00:18:59'>colour plotter chairs so that </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:00'>you can easily visualise this framework </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:03'>to the wider company and team members, you know. </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:06'>Here is what to focus we're gonna do for this quarter, </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:09'>what will be the important for us? </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:12'>And here's like salary result </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:14'>I've been achieving residency for various Lessing research. </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:17'>Even within the framework </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:18'>when I joined the company six months ago </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:20'>you can see that they've the, the weekly sign up, </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:23'>the user sign up has been realising rolling out </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:27'>the strategy for Hong Kong </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:29'>and they start to do the weekly testing experiments </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:32'>with different like tests results. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:19:35'>And you can see the sun has been increased </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:36'>by at least three times for the past few months now. </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:39'>And not only that, but the speed experience also </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:43'>very important because you can see </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:44'>like before we start running experience </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:46'>like we didn't see any like growth and sign up at all </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:49'>but then what, then when we start </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:51'>you have the experience at least like two or three per week </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:54'>then we can see that there is significant increase </span> <span data-startTime='00:19:57'>in the sign up of velocity. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:19:59'>And you can see the correlation co efficiency is quite high. </span> <span data-startTime='00:20:03'>So I suppose the report 0.9%. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:20:05'>So that means like, with when experience is a part </span> <span data-startTime='00:20:09'>of the habit and the weekly routine </span> <span data-startTime='00:20:12'>it can help you to let have the sustainable </span> <span data-startTime='00:20:15'>and significant growth for company. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:20:17'>And it's also long-term as well. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:20:19'>And to wrap-ups, that's why it's important for any company. </span> <span data-startTime='00:20:25'>You should always like think about user as the car </span> <span data-startTime='00:20:28'>so that all of the team can work well together, </span> <span data-startTime='00:20:31'>the product the growth and the data teams, </span> <span data-startTime='00:20:33'>whatever they do the strategy should ally with, like </span> <span data-startTime='00:20:35'>whether is like impact the user, add value to them. </span> <span data-startTime='00:20:39'>Whereas from acquisition perspective, retention, activation </span> <span data-startTime='00:20:42'>and referral, and to summarise. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:20:44'>So for any startup, any team always start </span> <span data-startTime='00:20:47'>with the objective of what is come heading, </span> <span data-startTime='00:20:50'>where they want you to achieve this quarter, </span> <span data-startTime='00:20:52'>from there you cut the side what qualitative insight </span> <span data-startTime='00:20:56'>and quantitative insight the unit on need to capture </span> <span data-startTime='00:20:58'>if you don't have it </span> <span data-startTime='00:20:59'>and have you start tracking so that in a few weeks time </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:01'>you can have the data to validate your assumption. </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:04'>And from there you start </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:05'>you have like the product roadmap from the product team. </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:08'>And from there, you can start to break down to like </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:10'>what are some of the growth project </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:11'>that can line up with those products? </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:13'>So you can have the productivity launch, the </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:16'>the new feature much better </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:18'>and can allow with a growth initiative as well. </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:21'>And from the, where we can start </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:22'>you run the growth experiment as a happen. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:21:25'>And of course, don't forget about the user </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:27'>on the design overhead. </span> </p>
		<p><span data-startTime='00:21:28'>Think of us as a car, </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:29'>what was the objective to product feature, </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:32'>the project has impacted user which part </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:34'>of the digital journey that you have making impact on </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:38'>and last but not the least so I had to keep like, </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:40'>fine tuning the operation, the process, the frame </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:43'>to make sure that it's working for a company </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:46'>'cause like on one size fits all for the startup. </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:49'>You have to think of like </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:50'>what framework, what work out the best for you </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:51'>based on the resource, the team </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:53'>the business model and process you have </span> <span data-startTime='00:21:56'>and that's is for today. </span> </p>
